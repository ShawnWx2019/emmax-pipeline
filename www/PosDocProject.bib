  abstract = {The SCF complex is a widely studied multi-subunit ring E3 ubiquitin ligase that tags targeted proteins with ubiquitin for protein degradation by the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome system (UPS). The UPS is an important system that generally keeps cellular events tightly regulated by purging misfolded or damaged proteins and selectively degrading important regulatory proteins. The specificity of this post-translational regulation is controlled by F-box proteins (FBPs) via selective recognition of a protein\textendash protein interaction motif at the C-terminal domain. Hence, FBPs are pivotal proteins in determining the plant response in multiple scenarios. It is not surprising that the FBP family is one of the largest protein families in the plant kingdom. In this review, the roles of FBPs, specifically in plants, are compiled to provide insights into their involvement in secondary metabolites, plant stresses, phytohormone signalling, plant developmental processes and miRNA biogenesis.},

  abstract = {Hybrid crop varieties have been repeatedly demonstrated to produce significantly higher yields than their parental lines; however, the low efficiency and high cost of hybrid seed production has limited the broad exploitation of heterosis for cotton production. One option for increasing the yield of hybrid seed is to improve pollination efficiency by insect pollinators. Here, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a semidominant gene, Beauty Mark (BM), which controls purple spot formation at the base of flower petals in the cultivated tetraploid cotton species Gossypium barbadense. BM encodes an R2R3 MYB113 transcription factor, and we demonstrate that GbBM directly targets the promoter of four flavonoid biosynthesis genes to positively regulate petal spot development. Introgression of a GbBM allele into G. hirsutum by marker-assisted selection restored petal spot formation, which significantly increased the frequency of honeybee visits in G. hirsutum. Moreover, field tests confirmed that cotton seed yield was significantly improved in a three-line hybrid production system that incorporated the GbBM allele. Our study thus provides a basis for the potentially broad application of this gene in improving the long-standing problem of low seed production in elite cotton hybrid lines.},

Flavonoid biosynthesis is one of the best-studied secondary metabolite pathways in plants. In the model system Arabidopsis thaliana it leads to the synthesis of three phenolic compound classes: flavonol glycosides, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs). PAs appear brown in their oxidised polymeric forms, and most A. thaliana mutants impaired in flavonoid accumulation were identified through screens for lack of this seed coat pigmentation. These mutants are referred to as transparent testa (tt) or tannin-deficient seed (tds). More than 20 mutants of these types have been published, probably representing most of the genes relevant for PA accumulation in A. thaliana. However, data about the genes involved in PA deposition or oxidation are still rather scarce. Also, for some of the known mutants it is unclear if they represent additional loci or if they are allelic to known genes. For the present study, we have performed a systematic phenotypic characterisation of almost all available tt and tds mutants and built a collection of mutants in the genetic background of the accession Columbia to minimise effects arising from ecotype variation. We have identified a novel tt6 allele from a forward genetic screen and demonstrated that tds3 is allelic to tt12 and tds5 to aha10.},

  abstract = {The fruit of the pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is an important nutraceutical food rich in polyphenolic compounds, including hydrolysable tannins, anthocyanins and flavonols. Their composition varies according to cultivar, tissue and fruit development stage and is probably regulated by a combination of MYB and bHLH type transcription factors (TFs). In this study, metabolomics analysis during fruit developmental stages in the main pomegranate cultivars, Wonderful and Valenciana with contrasting colour of their ripe fruits, showed that flavonols were mostly present in flowers while catechins were highest in unripe fruits and anthocyanins in late fruit maturation stages. A novel MYB TF, PgMYB5-like, was identified, which differs from previously isolated pomegranate TFs by unique C-terminal protein motifs and lack of the amino-acid residues conserved among anthocyanins promoting MYBs. In both pomegranate cultivars the expression of PgMYB5-like was high at flowering stage, while it decreased during fruit ripening. A previously identified bHLH-type TF, PgbHLH, also showed high transcript levels at flowering stage in both cultivars, while it showed a decrease in expression during fruit ripening in cv. Valenciana, but not in cv. Wonderful. Functional analysis of both TFs was performed by agro-infiltration into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Plants infiltrated with the PgMYB5-like+PgbHLH combined construct showed a specific and significant accumulation of intermediates of the flavonoid pathway, especially dihydroflavonols, while anthocyanins were not produced. Thus, we propose a role for PgMYB5-like and PgbHLH in the first steps of flavonoid production in flowers and in unripe fruits. The expression patterns of these two TFs may be key in determining the differential flavonoid composition in both flowers and fruits of the pomegranate varieties Wonderful and Valenciana.},

Additionally, the effects of different strategies for controlling familywise error rate or false discovery and how they work with the different strategies for missing value imputation have been evaluated. Missing values were found to affect normality and variance of data and k-means nearest neighbour imputation was the best method tested for restoring this. Bonferroni correction was the best method for maximizing true positives and minimizing false positives and it was observed that as low as 40\% missing data could be truly missing. The range between 40 and 70\% missing values was defined as a ``gray area'' and therefore a strategy has been proposed that provides a balance between the optimal imputation strategy that was k-means nearest neighbor and the best approximation of positioning real zeros.},

Here, by studying circRNAs that we identified in neuronal tissues, we provide evidence that animal circRNAs are generated cotranscriptionally and that their production rate is mainly determined by intronic sequences. We demonstrate that circularization and splicing compete against each other. These mechanisms are tissue specific and conserved in animals. Interestingly, we observed that the second exon of the splicing factor muscleblind (MBL/MBNL1) is circularized in flies and humans. This circRNA (circMbl) and its flanking introns contain conserved muscleblind binding sites, which are strongly and specifically bound by MBL. Modulation of MBL levels strongly affects circMbl biosynthesis, and this effect is dependent on the MBL binding sites. Together, our data suggest that circRNAs can function in gene regulation by competing with linear splicing. Furthermore, we identified muscleblind as a factor involved in circRNA biogenesis.},

Ignoring outliers or non-normality can significantly inflate Type I error rates. We found that rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) and trait winsorisation were both effective at maintaining Type I error control without sacrificing power in the presence of outliers. INT was the optimal method for non-normally distributed traits. For RVAS of quantitative traits with outliers or non-normality, we recommend using INT to transform phenotypic values before association testing.},

The cotton fiber of commerce is a cellulosic secondary wall surrounded by a thin cuticulated primary wall, but there were only sparse details available about the polysaccharides in the fiber cell wall of any cotton species. In addition, Gossypium hirsutum (Gh) fiber was known to have an adhesive cotton fiber middle lamella (CFML) that joins adjacent fibers into tissue-like bundles, but it was unknown whether a CFML existed in other commercially important cotton fibers. We compared the cell wall chemistry over the time course of fiber development in Gh and Gossypium barbadense (Gb), the two most important commercial cotton species, when plants were grown in parallel in a highly controlled greenhouse. Under these growing conditions, the rate of early fiber elongation and the time of onset of secondary wall deposition were similar in fibers of the two species, but as expected the Gb fiber had a prolonged elongation period and developed higher quality compared to Gh fiber. The Gb fibers had a CFML, but it was not directly required for fiber elongation because Gb fiber continued to elongate rapidly after CFML hydrolysis. For both species, fiber at seven ages was extracted with four increasingly strong solvents, followed by analysis of cell wall matrix polysaccharide epitopes using antibody-based Glycome Profiling. Together with immunohistochemistry of fiber cross-sections, the data show that the CFML of Gb fiber contained lower levels of xyloglucan compared to Gh fiber. Xyloglucan endo-hydrolase activity was also higher in Gb fiber. In general, the data provide a rich picture of the similarities and differences in the cell wall structure of the two most important commercial cotton species.},

  abstract = {Although much is known about plant traits that function in nonhost resistance against pathogens, little is known about nonhost resistance against herbivores, despite its agricultural importance. Empoasca leafhoppers, serious agricultural pests, identify host plants by eavesdropping on unknown outputs of jasmonate (JA)-mediated signaling. Forward- and reverse-genetics lines of a native tobacco plant were screened in native habitats with native herbivores using high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic tools to reveal an Empoasca-elicited JA-JAZi module. This module induces an uncharacterized caffeoylputrescine-green leaf volatile compound, catalyzed by a polyphenol oxidase in a Michael addition reaction, which we reconstitute in vitro; engineer in crop plants, where it requires a berberine bridge enzyme-like 2 (BBL2) for its synthesis; and show that it confers resistance to leafhoppers. Natural history-guided forward genetics reveals a conserved nonhost resistance mechanism useful for crop protection.},

  abstract = {The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) is a community-based bioinformatics project that classifies gene product function through the use of structured controlled vocabularies. A fundamental application of the Gene Ontology (GO) is in the creation of gene product annotations, evidence-based associations between GO definitions and experimental or sequence-based analysis. Currently, the GOC disseminates 126 million annotations covering {$>$}374 000 species including all the kingdoms of life. This number includes two classes of GO annotations: those created manually by experienced biocurators reviewing the literature or by examination of biological data (1.1 million annotations covering 2226 species) and those generated computationally via automated methods. As manual annotations are often used to propagate functional predictions between related proteins within and between genomes, it is critical to provide accurate consistent manual annotations. Toward this goal, we present here the conventions defined by the GOC for the creation of manual annotation. This guide represents the best practices for manual annotation as established by the GOC project over the past 12 years. We hope this guide will encourage research communities to annotate gene products of their interest to enhance the corpus of GO annotations available to all., Database URL: http://www.geneontology.org},

  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) displays an exceptional degree of structural genomic diversity [1, 2]. In addition, variation in gene expression further contributes to the extraordinary phenotypic diversity and plasticity of maize. This study provides a systematic investigation on how distantly related homozygous maize inbred lines affect the transcriptomic plasticity of their highly heterozygous F1 hybrids. The classical dominance model of heterosis explains the superiority of hybrid plants by the complementation of deleterious parental alleles by superior alleles of the second parent at many loci [3]. Genes active in one inbred line but inactive in another represent an extreme instance of allelic diversity defined as single-parent expression [4]. We observed on average {$\sim$}1,000 such genes in all~inbred line combinations during primary root development. These genes consistently displayed expression complementation (i.e., activity) in their hybrid progeny. Consequently, extreme expression complementation is a general mechanism that results on average in {$\sim$}600 additionally active genes and their encoded biological functions in hybrids. The modern maize genome is complemented by a set of non-syntenic genes, which emerged after the separation of the maize and sorghum lineages and lack syntenic orthologs in any other grass species [5]. We demonstrated that non-syntenic genes are the driving force of gene expression complementation in hybrids. Among those, the highly diversified families of bZIP and bHLH transcription factors [6] are systematically overrepresented. In summary, extreme gene expression complementation extensively shapes the transcriptomic plasticity of maize hybrids and might therefore be one factor controlling the developmental plasticity of hybrids.},

Relatively little is understood about the complexity of regulatory evolution accompanying crop domestication, particularly for polyploid plants. Here, we compare the fiber transcriptomes between wild and domesticated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and their reciprocal F1 hybrids, revealing genome-wide (\textasciitilde 15\%) and often compensatory cis and trans regulatory changes under divergence and domestication. The high level of trans evolution (54\%-64\%) observed is likely enabled by genomic redundancy following polyploidy. Our results reveal that regulatory variation is significantly associated with sequence evolution, inheritance of parental expression patterns, co-expression gene network properties, and genomic loci responsible for domestication traits. With respect to regulatory evolution, the two subgenomes of allotetraploid cotton are often uncoupled. Overall, our work underscores the complexity of regulatory evolution during fiber domestication and may facilitate new approaches for improving cotton and other polyploid plants.},

While mass spectrometry-based (MS) metabolomics assays are endowed with high throughput and sensitivity, MWAS are doomed to long-term data acquisition generating an overtime-analytical signal drift that can hinder the uncovering of real biologically relevant changes. We developed "dbnorm", a package in the R environment, which allows for an easy comparison of the model performance of advanced statistical tools commonly used in metabolomics to remove batch effects from large metabolomics datasets. "dbnorm" integrates advanced statistical tools to inspect the dataset structure not only at the macroscopic (sample batches) scale, but also at the microscopic (metabolic features) level. To compare the model performance on data correction, "dbnorm" assigns a score that help users identify the best fitting model for each dataset. In this study, we applied "dbnorm" to two large-scale metabolomics datasets as a proof of concept. We demonstrate that "dbnorm" allows for the accurate selection of the most appropriate statistical tool to efficiently remove the overtime signal drift and to focus on the relevant biological components of complex datasets.},

Subsequent studies revealed that the expression of circRNAs is developmentally regulated, tissue and cell-type specific, and shared across the eukaryotic tree of life. These features suggest important functions for these molecules. Here, we describe major advances in the field of circRNA biology, focusing on the regulation of and functional roles played by these molecules.},

In addition to its commercial importance, cotton fiber has several attributes that make it an experimental system of choice for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes accompanying cell elongation and/or maturation. The fiber originates and ends as a single cell, and thus elongation can be studied free of any complications from cell division. The variability in fiber length and secondary wall thickness of fibers among different cotton varieties depends upon the interplay of a complex pattern of metabolic processes and regulating mechanisms that govern fiber growth. The in vitro methodology of cotton ovule culture holds considerable promise for investigating the effects of a number of plant growth substances on cell growth. The developing cotton fibers provide a rich source of homogeneous single cells, which should be preferred for structural and biosynthetic studies of the cell wall.},

Pan-genomes represent the genomic diversity of a species and includes core genes, found in all individuals, as well as variable genes, which are absent in some individuals. Variable gene annotations often show similarities across plant species, with genes for biotic and abiotic stress commonly enriched within variable gene groups.

  abstract = {Aliphatic glucosinolates are compounds which occur in high concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassicaceae species. They are important for the resistance of the plant to pest insects. Previously, the biosynthesis of these compounds was shown to be regulated by transcription factors MYB28 and MYB29. We now show that MYB28 and MYB29 are partially redundant, but in the absence of both, the synthesis of all aliphatic glucosinolates is blocked. Untargeted and targeted biochemical analyses of leaf metabolites showed that differences between single and double knock-out mutants and wild type plants were restricted to glucosinolates. Biosynthesis of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates was blocked by the myb28 mutation, while short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates were reduced by about 50\% in both the myb28 and the myb29 single mutants. Most remarkably, all aliphatic glucosinolates were completely absent in the double mutant. Expression of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes was slightly but significantly reduced by the single myb mutations, while the double mutation resulted in a drastic decrease in expression of these genes. Since the myb28myb29 double mutant is the first Arabidopsis genotype without any aliphatic glucosinolates, we used it to establish the relevance of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis to herbivory by larvae of the lepidopteran insect Mamestra brassicae. Plant damage correlated inversely to the levels of aliphatic glucosinolates observed in those plants: Larval weight gain was 2.6 fold higher on the double myb28myb29 mutant completely lacking aliphatic glucosinolates and 1.8 higher on the single mutants with intermediate levels of aliphatic glucosinolates compared to wild type plants.},

  abstract = {Because of the ever-increasing number of signals that can be measured within a single run by modern platforms in analytical chemistry, life sciences datasets become not only gradually larger but also more intricate in their structures. Challenges related to making use of this wealth of data include extracting relevant elements within massive amounts of signals possibly spread across different tables, reducing dimensionality, summarising dynamic information in a comprehensible way and displaying it for interpretation purposes. Metabolomics constitutes a representative example of fast-moving research fields taking advantage of recent technological advances to provide extensive sample monitoring. Because of the wide chemical diversity of metabolites, several analytical setups are required to provide a broad coverage of complex samples. The integration and visualisation of multiple highly multivariate datasets constitute key issues for effective analysis leading to valuable biological or chemical knowledge. Additionally, high-order data structures arise from experimental setups involving time-resolved measurements. These data are intrinsically multiway, and classical statistical tools cannot be applied without altering their organisation with the risk of information loss. Dedicated modelling algorithms, able to cope with the inherent properties of these metabolomic datasets, are therefore mandatory for harnessing their complexity and provide relevant information. In that perspective, chemometrics has a central role to play. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here we demonstrate that OsFBK1 is another functional orthologue of HWS and show the complexity of interaction between EP3 and OsFBK1 genes at different developmental stages of the plant. qRT-PCR expression analyses and studies of EP3-GFP and OsFBK1-RFP promoter reporter lines demonstrate that although EP3 and OsFBK1 expression can be detected in the same tissues some cells exclusively express EP3 or OsFBK1 whilst others co-express both genes. Loss, reduction or gain-of-function lines for EP3 and OsFBK1, show that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect plant architecture, organ size, floral organ number and size, floral morphology, pollen viability, grain size and weight. We have identified the putative orthologue genes of the rice microRNA pathway for ORYZA SATIVA DAWDLE (OsDDL) and ORYZA SATIVA SERRATE (OsSE), and demonstrated that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect their transcript levels as well as those of CROWN ROOT DEFECT 1/ORYZA SATIVA Exportin-5 HASTY (CRD1/OsHST), ORYZA SATIVA DICER-LIKE 1 (OsDCL) and ORYZA SATIVA WEAVY LEAF1 (OsWAF1). We show that EP3 affects OsPri-MIR164, OsNAM1 and OsNAC1 transcript levels. OsNAC1 transcripts are modified by OsFBK1, suggesting two independent regulatory pathways, one via EP3 and OsMIR164 and the other via OsFBK1.

  abstract = {Despite the essential role of specialized metabolites (SMs) in the interaction of plants with the environment, studying the ability of crop seeds to produce these protective compounds has been neglected. Furthermore, seeds produce a myriad of SMs, providing an interesting model to investigate their diversity and plasticity. Camelina sativa gained a lot of interest in the past few years as a rustic oilseed crop. A characterization of seed SM landscapes in six camelina genotypes grown in the field and harvested during five growing seasons has been undertaken in this work. This allowed a comprehensive annotation of seed SMs combining analyses that cluster SMs based on their chemical structures and co-accumulation patterns. These data showed broad effects of the environment on the stimulation of the seed SM. Among well-annotated compounds, flavonols were identified as the metabolic class characterized by high plasticity, revealing significant variable accumulation according to the year and/or the genotype. Lastly, a deeper characterization of primary metabolites and lipids in two selected genotypes has been performed. We showed that, in addition to flavonols, alkaloids and glucosinolates displayed a higher phenotypic plasticity with respect to most of the primary metabolites, including some sugars and major storage compounds such as fatty acids, proteins and most lipid classes (e.g. diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols), but similar plasticity compared with free amino acids and carboxylic acids. This work highlighted major and unexplored effects of the environment on the seed SM, demonstrating that seeds exhibit a dynamic and plastic metabolism, with an impact on seed quality.},

  abstract = {Plants are the sole source of flavonoids, a chemical category that includes flavonols. For the most part, flavonols occur as glycosides with numerous postulated biological roles in plants, including photoprotection, modulation of hormone translocation, and sequestration of reactive oxygen species. Flavonol glycosides are often considered as dead-end metabolites because related flavonoids (i.e., anthocyanins) occur in terminal tissues such as flowers and fruit, but recent evidence points to their turnover in planta, including developing photosynthetic tissues. Although microbial degradation pathways for flavonol glycosides of plant origin are well described, plant catabolic pathways are little studied by comparison. This review will address our current understanding of biochemical processes leading to the loss of flavonol glycosides in plants, with a specific emphasis on the evidence for flavonol-specific {$\beta$}-glucosidases. Complete elucidation of these catabolic pathways is dependent on the identification of regiospecific modifying steps, including enzymes associated with the hydrolysis of rhamnosylated flavonols, as well as flavonol peroxidation and their encoding genes. Herein, we highlight challenges for the identification of hypothetical plant {$\alpha$}-rhamnosidases and peroxidases involved in flavonol glycoside degradation, and the potential biological role of this catabolism in mitigating oxidative stress in developing and postharvest plant tissues.},

A number of synthetic compounds have been shown to block the process of auxin transport by inhibition of the auxin efflux carrier complex. These synthetic auxin transport inhibitors may act by mimicking endogenous molecules. Flavonoids, a class of secondary plant metabolic compounds, have been suggested to be auxin transport inhibitors based on their in vitro activity. The hypothesis that flavonoids regulate auxin transport in vivo was tested in Arabidopsis by comparing wild-type (WT) and transparent testa (tt4) plants with a mutation in the gene encoding the first enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis, chalcone synthase. In a comparison between tt4 and WT plants, phenotypic differences were observed, including three times as many secondary inflorescence stems, reduced plant height, decreased stem diameter, and increased secondary root development. Growth of WT Arabidopsis plants on naringenin, a biosynthetic precursor to those flavonoids with auxin transport inhibitor activity in vitro, leads to a reduction in root growth and gravitropism, similar to the effects of synthetic auxin transport inhibitors. Analyses of auxin transport in the inflorescence and hypocotyl of independent tt4 alleles indicate that auxin transport is elevated in plants with a tt4 mutation. In hypocotyls of tt4, this elevated transport is reversed when flavonoids are synthesized by growth of plants on the flavonoid precursor, naringenin. These results are consistent with a role for flavonoids as endogenous regulators of auxin transport.},

Significant differences were noted among organs in both glucosinolate concentration and composition. Dormant and germinating seeds had the highest concentration (2.5\textendash 3.3\% by dry weight), followed by inflorescences, siliques (fruits), leaves and roots. While aliphatic glucosinolates predominated in most organs, indole glucosinolates made up nearly half of the total composition in roots and late-stage rosette leaves. Seeds had a very distinctive glucosinolate composition. They possessed much higher concentrations of several types of aliphatic glucosinolates than other organs, including methylthioalkyl and, hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates and compounds with benzoate esters than other organs. From a developmental perspective, older leaves had lower glucosinolate concentrations than younger leaves, but this was not due to decreasing concentrations in individual leaves with age (glucosinolate concentration was stable during leaf expansion). Rather, leaves initiated earlier in development simply had much lower rates of glucosinolate accumulation per dry weight gain throughout their lifetimes. During seed germination and leaf senescence, there were significant declines in glucosinolate concentration. The physiological and ecological significance of these findings is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The old observation that plants preferentially synthesize flavonoids with respect to the wide range of phenylpropanoid structures when exposed to high doses of UV-B radiation has supported the view that flavonoids are primarily involved in absorbing the shortest solar wavelengths in photoprotection. However, there is compelling evidence that the biosynthesis of flavonoids is similarly upregulated in response to high photosynthetically active radiation in the presence or in the absence of UV-radiation, as well as in response to excess metal ions and photosynthetic redox unbalance. This supports the hypothesis that flavonoids may play prominent roles as scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by light excess. These `antioxidant' functions of flavonoids appears robust, as maintained between different life kingdoms, e.g., plants and animals. The ability of flavonoids to buffer stress-induced large alterations in ROS homeostasis and, hence, to modulate the ROS-signaling cascade, is at the base of well-known functions of flavonoids as developmental regulators in both plants and animals. There is both long and very recent evidence indeed that, in plants, flavonoids may strongly affect phytohormone signaling, e.g., auxin and abscisic acid signaling. This function is served by flavonoids in a very low (nM) concentration range and involves the ability of flavonoids to inhibit the activity of a wide range of protein kinases, including but not limited to mitogen-activated protein kinases, that operate downstream of ROS in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. For example, flavonoids inhibit the transport of auxin acting on serine\textendash threonine PINOID (PID) kinases that regulate the localization of auxin efflux facilitators PIN-formed (PIN) proteins. Flavonoids may also determine auxin gradients at cellular and tissue levels, and the consequential developmental processes, by reducing auxin catabolism. Recent observations lead to the hypothesis that regulation/modulation of auxin transport/signaling is likely an ancestral function of flavonoids. The antagonistic functions of flavonoids on ABA-induced stomatal closure also offer novel hypotheses on the functional role of flavonoids in plant\textendash environment interactions, in early as well as in modern terrestrial plants. Here, we surmise that the regulation of phytohormone signaling might have represented a primary function served by flavonols for the conquest of land by plants and it is still of major significance for the successful acclimation of modern terrestrial plants to a severe excess of radiant energy.},

While these active compounds with nutraceutical and defensive properties, and their germplasm sources have been elucidated for maize, especially those related to phenolic compounds, some compounds such as hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs) are poorly studied. In this investigation, the distribution of HCAAs was investigated in 32 Mexican landraces to provide an estimation of the range of variability of HCAA content in maize kernel. Kernel tissues were analysed to localize and quantify these compounds. The variation in HCAAs was also analysed in relation of its eco-geographical origin, distribution and as taxonomic marker. The major compounds determined were diferuloyl putrescine, feruloyl putrescine and cinnamoyl putrescine. Ranges of concentration were detected from 428 to 2336\,{$\mu$}g/g for diferuloyl putrescine meanwhile feruloyl putrescine and cinnamoyl putrescine were quantified from 6 to 85\,{$\mu$}g/g. A significant correlation (r2\,=\,0.603, p\,=\,0.018) was found between the maximum altitude of origin of the landrace and the concentration of diferuloyl putrescine in the external grain tissues. This relationship suggests that the maize with high HCAAs content were selected in low altitudes environments under natural selection pressure. Maize landraces are proposed as sources of HCAAs for diverse purposes.},

We characterize each lincRNA by a panorama of {$>$}30 properties, including sequence, structural, transcriptional, and orthology features. We found that lincRNA expression is strikingly tissue-specific compared with coding genes, and that lincRNAs are typically coexpressed with their neighboring genes, albeit to an extent similar to that of pairs of neighboring protein-coding genes. We distinguish an additional subset of transcripts that have high evolutionary conservation but may include short ORFs and may serve as either lincRNAs or small peptides. Our integrated, comprehensive, yet conservative reference catalog of human lincRNAs reveals the global properties of lincRNAs and will facilitate experimental studies and further functional classification of these genes.},

Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K than those that stabilized. KA inhibits glutamate release, and glutamate abundance was lower in patients that clinically deteriorated and correlated with immune responses. Analysis of data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project revealed that the expression of the gene encoding the enzyme that produces KA, kynurenine aminotransferase, correlated with cytokine abundance and activation of immune responses in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes in COVID-19, suggesting a positive feedback between metabolites and immune responses in males.},

Cotton fiber cells are developmentally synchronous, highly elongated, and contain nearly pure cellulose when mature. Here, we report that the transcription factor GhTCP4 plays an important role in balancing cotton fiber cell elongation and wall synthesis. During fiber development the expression of miR319 declines while GhTCP4 transcript levels increase, with high levels of the latter promoting SCW deposition. GhTCP4 interacts with a homeobox-containing factor, GhHOX3, and repressing its transcriptional activity. GhTCP4 and GhHOX3 function antagonistically to regulate cell elongation, thereby establishing temporal control of fiber cell transition to the SCW stage. We found that overexpression of GhTCP4A~upregulated and accelerated activation of the SCW biosynthetic pathway in fiber cells, as revealed by transcriptome and promoter activity analyses, resulting in shorter fibers with varied lengths and thicker walls. In contrast, GhTCP4 downregulation led to slightly longer fibers and thinner cell walls. The GhHOX3\textendash GhTCP4 complex may represent a general mechanism of cellular development in plants since both are conserved factors in many species, thus providing us a potential molecular tool~for the design of fiber traits.},

  abstract = {Sry is expressed at higher levels in the adult testis, where no function has been determined, than in the genital ridge, its critical site of action. cDNA and 5' RACE clones isolated from testis or from Sry-transfected cell lines have an unusual structure, with 3' sequences located in a 5' position. RNAase protection assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions confirmed that these unusual RNA molecules represent the most abundant transcript in testis. Furthermore, oligonucleotide hybridization and RNAase H digestion proved that these Sry RNA molecules are circular. Similar transcripts were detected in the testes of mice with Mus musculus musculus, Mus musculus domesticus, and Mus spretus Sry genes. The circular RNA is found in the cytoplasm but is not substantially bound to polysomes. We suggest that the circles arise from normal splicing processes as a consequence of the unusual genomic structure surrounding the Sry locus in the mouse.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to assess the effects of manganese (Mn) toxicity on the proteome of tomato roots using two proteomic approaches, shotgun and two-dimensional electrophoresis. The shotgun approach yielded 367 reliable proteins, whereas the 2-DE approach detected 340 consistent spots. The 2-DE method found 54 proteins changing in relative abundance in the excess Mn treatment, whereas the shotgun detected changes in 118 proteins. Only 7\% of the differential proteins were found by both methods, illustrating their complementary nature. Metabolic pathways most affected were protein metabolism, oxido-reductases and signaling. Results support that Mn toxicity alters the protein turnover and impairs energy production in roots, leading to changes in glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, TCA and oxidative phosphorylation. Excess Mn also induced changes in peroxidases and hydrolases participating in cell wall lignification and suberization and activated plant defense mechanisms, with changes occurring via pathogenesis-related proteins as well as peroxidases. Finally, Mn toxicity elicited regulatory mechanisms and affected the abundance of root nutrient reservoir proteins. The overall analysis of the differential root proteome upon Mn toxicity suggests a general slowdown of metabolic activities, especially energy production, cell wall integrity and protein turnover, which occurs in parallel with increases in stress related proteins.},

  abstract = {Microbial natural product discovery programs face two main challenges today: rapidly prioritizing strains for discovering new molecules and avoiding the rediscovery of already known molecules. Typically, these problems have been tackled using biological assays to identify promising strains and techniques that model variance in a dataset such as PCA to highlight novel chemistry. While these tools have shown successful outcomes in the past, datasets are becoming much larger and require a new approach. Since PCA models are dependent on the members of the group being modeled, large datasets with many members make it difficult to accurately model the variance in the data. Our tool, hcapca, first groups strains based on the similarity of their chemical composition, and then applies PCA to the smaller sub-groups yielding more robust PCA models. This allows for scalable chemical comparisons among hundreds of strains with thousands of molecular features. As a proof of concept, we applied our open-source tool to a dataset with 1046 LCMS profiles of marine invertebrate associated bacteria and discovered three new analogs of an established anticancer agent from one promising strain.},

  abstract = {Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a leading cereal crop, but has lagged behind with respect to the interpretation of the molecular mechanisms of phenotypes compared with other major cereal crops such as rice and maize. The recently available genome sequence of wheat affords the pre-requisite information for efficiently exploiting the potential molecular resources for decoding the genetic architecture of complex traits and identifying valuable breeding targets. Meanwhile, the successful application of metabolomics as an emergent large-scale profiling methodology in several species has demonstrated this approach to be accessible for reaching the above goals. One such productive avenue is combining metabolomics approaches with genetic designs. However, this trial is not as widespread as that for sequencing technologies, especially when the acquisition, understanding, and application of metabolic approaches in wheat populations remain~more difficult and even arguably underutilized. In this review, we briefly introduce the techniques used in the acquisition of metabolomics data~and their utility in large-scale identification of functional candidate genes. Considerable progress~has been made in delivering improved varieties, suggesting that the inclusion of information concerning these metabolites and genes and metabolic pathways enables a more explicit understanding of phenotypic traits and, as such, this procedure could serve as an -omics-informed roadmap for executing similar improvement strategies in wheat and other species.},

However, the systematic identification of potential lncRNAs in trees is comparatively rare. In particular, the characteristics, expression, and regulatory roles of lncRNAs in trees under nutrient stress remain largely unknown. A genome-wide strategy was used in this investigation to identify and characterize novel and low-nitrogen (N)-responsive lncRNAs in Populus tomentosa; 388 unique lncRNA candidates belonging to 380~gene loci were detected and only seven lncRNAs were found to belong to seven conserved non-coding RNA families indicating the majority of P. tomentosa lncRNAs are species-specific. In total, 126 lncRNAs were significantly altered under low-N stress; 8 were repressed, and 118 were induced. Furthermore, 9 and 5 lncRNAs were detected as precursors of 11 known and 14 novel Populus miRNAs, respectively, whereas 4 lncRNAs were targeted by 29 miRNAs belonging to 5 families, including 22 conserved and 7 non-conserved miRNAs. In addition, 15 antisense lncRNAs were identified to be generated from opposite strands of 14 corresponding protein-coding genes. In total, 111 protein-coding genes with regions complementary to 38 lncRNAs were also predicted with some lncRNAs corresponding to multiple genes and vice versa, and their functions were annotated, which further demonstrated the complex regulatory relationship between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in plants. Moreover, an interaction network among lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs was investigated. These findings enrich our understanding of lncRNAs in Populus, expand the methods of miRNA identification. Our results present the first global characterization of lncRNAs and their potential target genes in response to nitrogen stress in trees, which provides more information on low-nutrition adaptation mechanisms in woody plants.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a family of transcripts with covalently closed circular structures and still largely unknown functions. Large numbers of circRNAs have been found in various biological processes in humans and animals, but fewer circRNAs have been identified in plants. We performed a genome-wide analysis of circRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana via deep sequencing. We constructed 14 strand-specific libraries from 13 samples from plants from four developmental stages, four stress treatments, and five organs and a mixed sample across the lifespan. In total, we identified 5861 circRNAs, including 1275 novel ones, using the strict threshold of at least two unique back-spliced supporting reads. The circRNAs were non-randomly distributed in all chromosomes; most were exonic. Sequence similarity analysis of circRNAs between A. thaliana and four other species showed that some circRNAs are conserved in plants. Functional annotation indicated that many parent genes of circRNAs are involved in many fundamental processes including plant development, reproduction, and response to stimulus. In addition, a small proportion of circRNAs were shown to be potential targets of miRNAs, indicating that the circRNAs could interact with miRNAs to regulate gene expression. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that circRNAs displayed diverse expression patterns at different growth stages. Our results provide an important resource for continuing circRNA research in A. thaliana, and should enhance our understanding of circRNAs in plants.

To explore the effect of internodes on ear height, the internodes under the ear were analysed in four commercial hybrids (Jinsai6850, Zhengdan958, Xundan20, and Yuyu22) from different heterotic groups in China. The eighth internode, which is the third aboveground extended internode, exhibited high-parent or over high-parent heterosis and contributed considerably to ear height. Thus, the proteome of the eighth internode was examined. Sixty-six protein spots with {$>$}1.5-fold differences in accumulation (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) among the four hybrids were identified by mass spectrometry and data analyses. Most of the differentially accumulated proteins exhibited additive accumulation patterns, but with epistatic effects on heterosis performance. Proteins involved in phenylpropanoid and benzoxazinoid metabolic pathways were observed to influence indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis and polar auxin transport during internode development. Moreover, indole-3-acetic acid content was positively correlated with the eighth internode length, but negatively correlated with the extent of the heterosis of the eighth internode length.},

Although they are commonly employed, full-scan MS methods such as quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS have been restricted by various factors including their limited linear range and complicated data processing. LC coupled with triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode is the gold standard for metabolite quantification; however, only known metabolites are generally quantified, limiting its applications in metabolomic analysis. In this study, a pseudotargeted approach was proposed to perform serum metabolomic analysis using an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/QQQ MS system operated in the MRM mode, for which the MRM ion pairs were acquired from the serum samples through untargeted tandem MS using UHPLC/Q-TOF MS. The UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted method displayed better repeatability and wider linear range than the traditional UHPLC/Q-TOF MS-based untargeted metabolomics method, and no complicated peak alignment was required. The developed method was applied to discover serum biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC had decreased lysophosphatidylcholine, increased long-chain and decreased medium-chain acylcarnitines, and increased aromatic and decreased branched-chain amino acid levels compared to healthy controls. The novelty of this work is that it provides an approach to acquire MRM ion pairs from real samples, is not limited to metabolite standards, and it provides a foundation to achieve pseudotargeted metabolomic analysis on the widely used LC/QQQ MS platform.},

This intrinsic characteristic has led to the general under-estimation of the existence of circular RNAs in previous polyadenylated transcriptome analyses. With the advent of specific biochemical and computational approaches, a large number of circular RNAs from back-spliced exons (circRNAs) have been identified in various cell lines and across different species. Recent studies have uncovered that back-splicing requires canonical spliceosomal machinery and can be facilitated by both complementary sequences and specific protein factors. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of the regulation of circRNA biogenesis, including both the competition between splicing and back-splicing and the previously under-appreciated alternative circularization.},

This expansion follows the 'master gene' model of amplification.The evolutionary impact of L1, Alu and SVA elements on the human genome is substantial and extremely diverse.L1, Alu and SVA elements generate instability at a local genomic scale owing to retrotransposon insertion (for example, insertion mutagenesis and DNA repair) and the effect of L1-encoded proteins (for example, the generation of DNA double-strand breaks). These elements also affect genome sequences across longer timescales through, for example, the seeding of microsatellites and gene conversion.L1, Alu and SVA elements also generate genomic rearrangements such as deletions, duplications and inversions, and therefore create structural variation in the genome through insertion-mediated deletions, ectopic recombination and the transduction of flanking sequences.L1, Alu and SVA elements have fostered genetic innovation during human and primate evolution through transduction-mediated gene formation, gene retrotransposition and exonization.L1, Alu and SVA elements also substantially shape human evolution at the RNA level by modulating the expression of nearby genes, RNA editing and epigenetic regulation.},

As succinate triggers inflammatory changes in macrophages, we investigated the significance of succinate in the pathogenesis of AAD and its clinical relevance. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used untargeted metabolomics and mass spectrometry to determine plasma succinate concentrations in 40 and 1665 individuals of the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. Three different murine AAD models were used to determine the role of succinate in AAD development. We further examined the role of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) and its transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB) in the context of macrophage-mediated inflammation and established p38{$\alpha$}MKOApoe-/- mice. Succinate was the most upregulated metabolite in the discovery cohort; this was confirmed in the validation cohort. Plasma succinate concentrations were higher in patients with AAD compared with those in healthy controls, patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Moreover, succinate administration aggravated angiotensin II-induced AAD and vascular inflammation in mice. In contrast, knockdown of OGDH reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in macrophages. The conditional deletion of p38{$\alpha$} decreased CREB phosphorylation, OGDH expression, and succinate concentrations. Conditional deletion of p38{$\alpha$} in macrophages reduced angiotensin II-induced AAD. CONCLUSION: Plasma succinate concentrations allow to distinguish patients with AAD from both healthy controls and patients with AMI or PE. Succinate concentrations are regulated by the p38{$\alpha$}-CREB-OGDH axis in macrophages.},

To date, diverse molecular markers have been used to guide field phenotypic selection, whereas accurate predictions of complex heterotic traits are rarely reported. Here, we present a practical metabolome-based strategy for predicting yield heterosis in rice. The dissection of population structure based on untargeted metabolite profiles as the initial critical step in multivariate modeling performed better than the screening of predictive variables. Then the assessment of each predictive variable's contribution to predictive models according to all latent factors was more precise than the conventional first one. Metabolites belonging to specific pathways were closely associated with yield heterosis, and the up-regulation of galactose metabolism promoted robust yield heterosis in hybrids under different growth conditions. Our study demonstrates that metabolome-based predictive models with correctly dissected population structure and screened predictive variables can facilitate accurate predictions of yield heterosis and have great potential for establishing molecular marker\textendash based precision breeding programs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In addition, every experiment is subject to within-platform and other experimental variation, which often includes unwanted biological variation. Such variation must be removed in order to focus on the biological information of interest. We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.},

Although the removal of this unwanted variation is a vital step in the analysis of metabolomics data, it is considered a gray area in which there is a recognised need to develop a better understanding of the procedures and statistical methods required to achieve statistically relevant optimal biological outcomes. In this paper, we discuss the causes of unwanted variation in metabolomics experiments, review commonly used metabolomics approaches for handling this unwanted variation, and present a statistical approach for the removal of unwanted variation to obtain normalized metabolomics data. The advantages and performance of the approach relative to several widely-used metabolomics normalization approaches are illustrated through two metabolomics studies, and recommendations are provided for choosing and assessing the most suitable normalization method for a given metabolomics experiment.

The p-value is outdated and does not make sense with big data: Everything becomes statistically significant. The root of the problem with the p-value is in the mean comparison. We argue that statistical uncertainty should be measured on the individual, not the group, level. Consequently, standard deviation (SD), not standard error (SE), error bars should be used to graphically present the data on two groups. We introduce a new measure based on the discrimination of individuals/objects from two groups, and call it the D-value. The D-value can be viewed as the n-of-1 p-value because it is computed in the same way as p while letting n equal 1. We show how the D-value is related to discrimination probability and the area above the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The D-value has a clear interpretation as the proportion of patients who get worse after the treatment, and as such facilitates to weigh up the likelihood of events under different scenarios.

  abstract = {Morchella sextelata is an edible and medicinal fungus with high nutritional, medicinal, and economic value. Recently, M. sextelata has been produced through artificial cultivation in China, but its stable production remains problematic because the details of its growth and development process are limitedly understood. Herein, to investigate the dynamic process of M. sextelata development, we integrated the transcriptomics and metabolomics data of M. sextelata from three developmental stages: the young mushroom period (YMP), marketable mature period (MMP), and physiological maturity period (PMP). The results showed that the transcriptome changed dynamically at different stages and demonstrated the significant enrichment of pathways that regulate plant growth and development, such as N-glycan biosynthesis and carbon and purine metabolism. Similarly, small-molecule metabolites, such as D-fructose-1,6-biphosphate, which was upregulated during the YMP, dihydromyricetin, which was upregulated during the MMP, and L-citrulline, which was upregulated during the PMP, also showed phase-dependent characteristics. Then, combined analysis of the transcriptome data and metabolome traits revealed that the transcriptome may affect metabolic molecules during different growth stages of M. sextelata via specific enzymes, such as {$\alpha$}-glucosidase and glucanase, which were included in two opposite transcriptome modules. In summary, this integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data for understanding the vegetative growth of M. sextelata during different developmental stages implicated several key genes, metabolites, and pathways involved in the vegetative growth. We believe that these findings will provide comprehensive insights into the dynamic process of growth and development in M. sextelata and new clues for optimizing the methods for its cultivation application.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics provides new insights into disease pathogenesis and biomarker discovery. Samples from large-scale untargeted metabolomics studies are typically analyzed using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform in several batches. Batch effects that are caused by non-biological systematic biases are unavoidable in large-scale metabolomics studies, even with properly designed experiments. The statistical analysis of large-scale metabolomics data without managing batch effects will yield misleading results. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, called WaveICA, which is based on the wavelet transform method with independent component analysis, as the threshold processing method to capture and remove batch effects for large-scale metabolomics data. The WaveICA method uses the time trend of samples over the injection order, decomposes the original data into multi-scale data with different features, extracts and removes the batch effect information in multi-scale data, and obtains clean data. The WaveICA method was tested on real metabolomics data. After applying the WaveICA method, scattered quality control samples (QCS) and subject samples in a PCA score plot of the original data were closely clustered, respectively. The average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks of the QCS increased from 0.872 to 0.972. Additionally, WaveICA significantly improved the classification accuracy for metabolomics data. The method was compared with three representative methods, and outperformed all of them. To conclude, WaveICA can efficiently remove batch effects while revealing more biological information. This method can be used in large-scale untargeted metabolomics studies to preprocess raw metabolomics data.},

We review established methodologies from related fields and describe solutions specific to proteomic challenges, such as ion intensity drift and missing values in quantitative feature matrices. Finally, we compile a set of techniques that enable control of batch effect adjustment quality. We provide an R package, 'proBatch', containing functions required for each step of the protocol. We demonstrate the utility of this methodology on five proteomic datasets each encompassing hundreds of samples and consisting of multiple experimental designs. In conclusion, we provide guidelines and tools to make the extraction of true biological signal from large proteomic studies more robust and transparent, ultimately facilitating reliable and reproducible research in clinical proteomics and systems biology.},

A matching revolution in our understanding of biological systems, however, will only be realized when similar advances are made in informatic analysis of the resulting ``big data.'' Here, we compare the capabilities of three conventional and novel statistical approaches to summarize and decipher the tomato metabolome. Methodology Principal component analysis (PCA), batch learning self-organizing maps (BL-SOM) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were applied to a multivariate NMR dataset collected from developmentally staged tomato fruits belonging to several genotypes. While PCA and BL-SOM are appropriate and commonly used methods, WGCNA holds several advantages in the analysis of highly multivariate, complex data. Conclusions PCA separated the two major genetic backgrounds (AC and NC), but provided little further information. Both BL-SOM and WGCNA clustered metabolites by expression, but WGCNA additionally defined ``modules'' of co-expressed metabolites explicitly and provided additional network statistics that described the systems properties of the tomato metabolic network. Our first application of WGCNA to tomato metabolomics data identified three major modules of metabolites that were associated with ripening-related traits and genetic background.},

In cotton, this family has not been well studied, especially in relation to fiber development. Here, the genomes and transcriptomes of Gossypium raimondii and Gossypium arboreum were investigated to identify fiber development related WRKY genes. This represents the first comprehensive comparative study of WRKY transcription factors in both diploid A and D cotton species. In total, 112 G. raimondii and 109 G. arboreum WRKY genes were identified. No significant gene structure or domain alterations were detected between the two species, but many SNPs distributed unequally in exon and intron regions. Physical mapping revealed that the WRKY genes in G. arboreum were not located in the corresponding chromosomes of G. raimondii, suggesting great chromosome rearrangement in the diploid cotton genomes. The cotton WRKY genes, especially subgroups I and II, have expanded through multiple whole genome duplications and tandem duplications compared with other plant species. Sequence comparison showed many functionally divergent sites between WRKY subgroups, while the genes within each group are under strong purifying selection. Transcriptome analysis suggested that many WRKY genes participate in specific fiber development processes such as fiber initiation, elongation and maturation with different expression patterns between species. Complex WRKY gene expression such as differential Dt and At allelic gene expression in G. hirsutum and alternative splicing events were also observed in both diploid and tetraploid cottons during fiber development process. In conclusion, this study provides important information on the evolution and function of WRKY gene family in cotton species.},

  abstract = {Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible.},

  abstract = {Phenylpropanoid metabolism is one of the most important metabolisms in plants, yielding more than 8,000 metabolites contributing to plant development and plant\textendash environment interplay. Phenylpropanoid metabolism materialized during the evolution of early freshwater algae that were initiating terrestrialization and land plants have evolved multiple branches of this pathway, which give rise to metabolites including lignin, flavonoids, lignans, phenylpropanoid esters, hydroxycinnamic acid amides, and sporopollenin. Recent studies have revealed that many factors participate in the regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism, and modulate phenylpropanoid homeostasis when plants undergo successive developmental processes and are subjected to stressful environments. In this review, we summarize recent progress on elucidating the contribution of phenylpropanoid metabolism to the coordination of plant development and plant\textendash environment interaction, and metabolic flux redirection among diverse metabolic routes. In addition, our review focuses on the regulation of phenylpropanoid metabolism at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic levels, and in response to phytohormones and biotic and abiotic stresses.},

  abstract = {Due to variation in instrument response caused by various sources of errors throughout an analytical assay, data normalization plays an indispensable role in untargeted LC-MS profiling, yet limited accepted guidelines on this topic exist. In this work, a systematic comparison of several normalization techniques, mainly focusing on internal standard-based approaches, has been performed to derive some general recommendations. For generation of untargeted lipidomic data, a comprehensive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-quadrupole time of flight (QTOF)-MS/MS method was utilized. To monitor instrument stability and evaluate normalization performance, quality control (QC) samples, prepared from aliquots of all experimental samples, were embedded in the sequence. Stable isotope labeled standards, representing differing lipid classes, were spiked to each sample as internal standards for postacquisition normalization. Various metrics were used to compare distinct normalization strategies, with reduction of variation in QC samples being the critical requirement for acceptance of successful normalization. The comparison of intragroup coefficients of variation (CVs), median absolute deviations (MADs), and variance enables simple selection of the best performance of normalization with improved and coherent results. Furthermore, the importance for normalization in critical data sets, showing only minor effects between groups with high variation and outliers, is pointed out. Apart from normalization, also, influences of used raw data types are demonstrated. In addition, effects of various factors throughout the processing workflow were investigated and optimized. Eventually, implementation of quality control samples, even if not required for normalization, provided a useful basis for assessing data quality. Due to lack of consensus for selecting optimum normalization, suggestions for validating data integrity are given.},

Nudicaulins, flavonoid-derived indole alkaloids, along with pelargonidin, kaempferol, and gossypetin glycosides, are responsible for the color of white, red, orange, and yellow petals of different Papaver nudicaule cultivars. The color of the petals is essential to attract pollinators. We investigated the occurrence of flavonoids in basal and apical petal areas, stamens, and capsules of four differently colored P. nudicaule cultivars by means of chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. The results reveal the specific occurrence of gossypetin glycosides in the basal spot of all cultivars and demonstrate that kaempferol glycosides are the major secondary metabolites in the capsules. Unlike previous reports, the yellow-colored stamens of all four P. nudicaule cultivars are shown to contain not nudicaulins but carotenoids. In addition, the presence of nudicaulins, pelargonidin, and kaempferol glycosides in the apical petal area was confirmed. The flavonoids and related compounds in the investigated flower parts and cultivars of P. nudicaule are profiled, and their potential ecological role is discussed.},

Independent analysis suggested that Chinese G. arboreum originated in South China and was subsequently introduced to the Yangtze and Yellow River regions. Most accessions with domestication-related traits experienced geographic isolation. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 98 significant peak associations for 11 agronomically important traits in G. arboreum. A nonsynonymous substitution (cysteine-to-arginine substitution) of GaKASIII seems to confer substantial fatty acid composition (C16:0 and C16:1) changes in cotton seeds. Resistance to fusarium wilt disease is associated with activation of GaGSTF9 expression. Our work represents a major step toward understanding the evolution of the A genome of cotton.},

In this scenario, understanding wild plant adaptations in extreme ecosystems offers an opportunity to learn about new mechanisms for resilience. Previous studies have shown species specificity for metabolites involved in plant adaptation to harsh environments. Here, we combined multispecies ecological metabolomics and machine learning-based generalized linear model predictions to link the metabolome to the plant environment in a set of 24 species belonging to 14 families growing along an altitudinal gradient in the Atacama Desert. Thirty-nine common compounds predicted the plant environment with 79\% accuracy, thus establishing the plant metabolome as an excellent integrative predictor of environmental fluctuations. These metabolites were independent of the species and validated both statistically and biologically using an independent dataset from a different sampling year. Thereafter, using multiblock predictive regressions, metabolites were linked to climatic and edaphic stressors such as freezing temperature, water deficit and high solar irradiance. These findings indicate that plants from different evolutionary trajectories use a generic metabolic toolkit to face extreme environments. These core metabolites, also present in agronomic species, provide a unique metabolic goldmine for improving crop performances under abiotic pressure.},

  abstract = {Plant trichomes are outgrowths developed from an epidermal pavement cells of leaves and other organs. Trichomes (also called \&lsquo;hairs\&rsquo;) play well-recognized roles in defense against insect herbivores, forming a physical barrier that obstructs insect movement and mediating chemical defenses. In addition, trichomes can act as a mechanosensory switch, transducing mechanical stimuli (e.g., insect movement) into physiological signals, helping the plant to respond to insect attacks. Hairs can also modulate plant responses to abiotic stresses, such as water loss, an excess of light and temperature, and reflect light to protect plants against UV radiation. The structure of trichomes is species-specific and this trait is generally related to their function. These outgrowths are easily analyzed and their origin represents an outstanding subject to study epidermal cell fate and patterning in plant organs. In leaves, the developmental control of the trichomatous complement has highlighted a regulatory network based on four fundamental elements: (i) genes that activate and/or modify the normal cell cycle of epidermal pavement cells (i.e., endoreduplication cycles); (ii) transcription factors that create an activator/repressor complex with a central role in determining cell fate, initiation, and differentiation of an epidermal cell in trichomes; (iii) evidence that underlines the interplay of the aforesaid complex with different classes of phytohormones; (iv) epigenetic mechanisms involved in trichome development. Here, we reviewed the role of genes in the development of trichomes, as well as the interaction between genes and hormones. Furthermore, we reported basic studies about the regulation of the cell cycle and the complexity of trichomes. Finally, this review focused on the epigenetic factors involved in the initiation and development of hairs, mainly on leaves.},

This study identified 495 NAC genes in three cotton species and investigated the evolution and expansion of different genome-derived NAC genes in cotton. We revealed 15 distinct NAC subfamilies in cotton. Different subfamilies had different gene proportions, expansion rate, gene loss rate, and orthologous exchange rate. Paleohexaploidization (35\%) and cotton-specific decaploidy (32\%) might have primarily led to the expansion of the NAC family in cotton. Half of duplication events in G. hirsutum were inherited from its diploid ancestor, and others might have occurred after interspecific hybridization. In addition, NAC genes in the At and Dt subgenomes displayed asymmetric molecular evolution, as evidenced by their different gene loss rates, orthologous exchange, evolutionary rates, and expression levels. The dominant duplication event was different during the cotton evolutionary history. Different genome-derived NACs might have interacted with each other, which ultimately resulted in morphogenetic evolution. This study delineated the expansion and evolutionary history of the NAC family in cotton and illustrated the different fates of NAC genes during polyploidization.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play roles in various biological processes, but their functions in the rice (Oryza sativa) response to Magnaporthe oryzae remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that circRNAs are involved in the rice-M. oryzae interaction using comparative circRNA-sequencing and transgenic approaches. We identified 2932 high-confidence circRNAs from young leaves of the blast-resistant accession International Rice Blast Line Pyricularia-Kanto51-m-Tsuyuake (IR25) and the blast-susceptible accession Lijiangxin Tuan Heigu (LTH) under M. oryzae-infected or uninfected conditions; 636 were detected specifically upon M. oryzae infection. The circRNAs in IR25 were significantly more diverse than those in LTH, especially under M. oryzae infection. Particularly, the number of circRNAs generated per parent gene was much higher in IR25 than in LTH and increased in IR25 but decreased in LTH upon M. oryzae infection. The higher diversity of circRNAs in IR25 was further associated with more frequent 3{${'}$} and 5{${'}$} alternative back-splicing and usage of complex splice sites. Moreover, a subset of circRNAs was differentially responsive to M. oryzae in IR25 and LTH. We further confirmed that circR5g05160 promotes rice immunity against M. oryzae. Therefore, our data indicate that circRNA diversity is associated with different responses to M. oryzae infection in rice and provide a starting point to investigate a new layer of regulation in the rice-M. oryzae interaction.},

Plants produce a huge array of metabolites, with an immense diversity at both the population and individual levels. Dissection of the genetic bases for metabolic diversity has attracted increasing research attention. The concept of genome-wide association study (GWAS) was extended to studies on the diversity of plant metabolome that benefitted from the development of mass-spectrometry-based analytical systems and genome sequencing technologies. Metabolic genome-wide association study (mGWAS) is one of the most powerful tools for global identification of genetic determinants for diversity of plant metabolism. Recently, mGWAS has been performed for various species with continuous improvements, providing deeper insights into the genetic bases of metabolic diversity. In this review, we discuss fully the achievements to date and remaining challenges that are associated with both mGWAS and mGWAS-based multi-dimensional analysis. We begin with a summary of GWAS and its development based on statistical methods and populations. As variation in targeted traits is essential for GWAS, we review metabolic diversity and its rise at both the population and individual levels. Subsequently, the application of mGWAS for plants and its corresponding achievements are fully discussed. We address the current knowledge on mGWAS-based multi-dimensional analysis and emerging insights into the diversity of metabolism.},

A study was conducted with the following objectives: (i) to determine if exotic tropical maize germplasm (TRMG) can increase diversity of Chinese maize germplasm for grain yield and five yield component traits (YCTs), namely, ear length (EL), ear diameter (ED), number of kernel rows per ear (RE), number of kernels per row (KR), and 1000-kernel weight (TKW), and (ii) to estimate general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects to identify a possible new heterotic pattern. Twenty-five temperate maize germplasm (TEMG) from both China and the United States were crossed with four TRMG from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). The 100 testcrosses were evaluated in field trials for grain yield and five YCTs at three locations in Yunnan, China. Tropical lines YML146 and YML145 showed, in crosses with most of the TEMG, significant positive SCA effects for grain yield and most of the YCTs, indicating that these lines had a different genetic base from that of TEMG and could increase genetic diversity of Chinese maize germplasm. The GCA effects were more important and reliable than SCA effects for heterotic pattern classification. Exotic line YML146 (derived from Suwan1) was identified as a new heterotic group, different from Reid, Lancaster, Tangsipingtou (TSPT), and Luda Red Cob (LDRC). A new heterotic pattern of temperate \texttimes{} Suwan1 was postulated, which could be as important as the widely accepted flint \texttimes{} dent heterotic pattern.},

Such data sets are usually acquired on one instrument over days or weeks of analysis time. Such extensive data acquisition processes introduce a variety of systematic errors, including batch differences, longitudinal drifts, or even instrument-to-instrument variation. Technical data variance can obscure the true biological signal and hinder biological discoveries. To combat this issue, we present a novel normalization approach based on using quality control pool samples (QC). This method is called systematic error removal using random forest (SERRF) for eliminating the unwanted systematic variations in large sample sets. We compared SERRF with 15 other commonly used normalization methods using six lipidomics data sets from three large cohort studies (832, 1162, and 2696 samples). SERRF reduced the average technical errors for these data sets to 5\% relative standard deviation. We conclude that SERRF outperforms other existing methods and can significantly reduce the unwanted systematic variation, revealing biological variance of interest.},

Among them, Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharides (PSP) are the main active ingredients and exhibit a broad range of pharmacological. Based on previous researches, identifying genes involved in PSP biosynthesis will help delineate such pathway at the molecular level. In that case, we performed RNA sequencing analysis for two sections of P. sibiricum Red.'s rhizomes significantly different in PSP content. A total of 435,858 unigenes were obtained by assembling transcripts from both sections and 29,548 (6.77\%) ones were annotated in all seven public databases. Analyzing count data of RNA-seq, 13,460 differential expression genes (DEGs) between two sections of rhizomes were acquired. After DEGs were mapped to KEGG databases, twelve represented KEGG pathways related to PSP biosynthesis were summed up. And most DEGs were assigned to the pathway of ``Starch and sucrose metabolism''. Finally, seventeen candidate genes whose expression levels were related to the polysaccharide content, were considered involving PSP biosynthesis in P. sibiricum Red. The present study lays a foundation of researching the molecular mechanisms of PSP biosynthesis.},

Using this phylogenetic framework and comparisons with expression changes accompanying F(1) hybridization, we provide a temporal perspective on expression diversification following a shared genome duplication. Global patterns of gene expression were studied by the hybridization of petal RNAs to a custom microarray. This platform measures total expression for c. 42 000 duplicated genes, and genome-specific expression for c. 1400 homoeologs (genes duplicated by polyploidy). We report homoeolog expression bias favoring the allopolyploid D genome over the A genome in all species (among five polyploid species, D biases ranging from c. 54 to 60\%), in addition to conservation of biases among genes. Furthermore, we find surprising levels of transgressive up- and down-regulation in the allopolyploids, a diminution of the level of bias in genomic expression dominance but not in its magnitude, and high levels of rate variation among allotetraploid species. We illustrate how phylogenetic and temporal components of expression evolution may be partitioned and revealed following allopolyploidy. Overall patterns of expression evolution are similar among the Gossypium allotetraploids, notwithstanding a high level of interspecific rate variation, but differ strikingly from the direction of genomic expression dominance patterns in the synthetic F(1) hybrid.},

To uncover dynamic biological mechanisms, bioinformatics tools have become essential to facilitating data interpretation in large-scale analyses. Global metabolomics is one such method for performing systems biology, as metabolites represent the downstream functional products of ongoing biological processes. We have developed XCMS Online, a platform that enables online metabolomics data processing and interpretation. A systems biology workflow recently implemented within XCMS Online enables rapid metabolic pathway mapping using raw metabolomics data for investigating dysregulated metabolic processes. In addition, this platform supports integration of multi-omic (such as genomic and proteomic) data to garner further systems-wide mechanistic insight. Here, we provide an in-depth procedure showing how to effectively navigate and use the systems biology workflow within XCMS Online without a priori knowledge of the platform, including uploading liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) data from metabolite-extracted biological samples, defining the job parameters to identify features, correcting for retention time deviations, conducting statistical analysis of features between sample classes and performing predictive metabolic pathway analysis. Additional multi-omics data can be uploaded and overlaid with previously identified pathways to enhance systems-wide analysis of the observed dysregulations. We also describe unique visualization tools to assist in elucidation of statistically significant dysregulated metabolic pathways.

Conclusions 271 Acknowledgements 273 References 273 Summary The basic components of the plant cell cycle are G1 (postmitotic interphase), S-phase (DNA synthesis phase), G2 (premitotic interphase) and mitosis/cytokinesis. Proliferating cells are phosphoregulated by cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs). Plant D-type cyclins are sensors of the G0 to G1 transition, and are also important for G2/M. At G1/S, the S-phase transcription factor, `E2F', is released from inhibitory retinoblastoma protein. Negative regulation of G1 events is through KRPs (Kip-related proteins). Plant S-phase genes are similar to animal ones, but timing of expression can be different (e.g. CDC6 at the start of S-phase) and functional evidence is limited. At G2/M, A-type and the unique B-type CDKs when bound to A, B and D cyclins, drive cells into division; they are negatively regulated by ICK1/2 and perhaps also by WEE1 kinase. In Arabidopsis, a putative CDC25 lacks a regulatory domain. Mitosis depends on correct temporal activity of CDKs, Aurora kinases and anaphase promotion complex; CDK-cyclin B activity beyond metaphase is catastrophic. Endoreduplication (re-replication of DNA in the absence of mitosis) is characterized by E2F expression and down-regulation of mitotic cyclins. Some cell size data support, whilst others negate, the idea of cell size having an impact on development.},

  abstract = {The performance of hybrids can be predicted with gene expression data from their parental inbred lines. Implementing such prediction approaches in breeding programs promises to increase the efficiency of hybrid breeding. The objectives of our study were to compare the accuracy of prediction models employing multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLS), support vector machine regression (SVM), and transcriptome-based distances (DB). For a factorial of 7 flint and 14 dent maize lines, the grain yield of the hybrids was assessed and the gene expression of the parental lines was profiled with a 56k microarray. The accuracy of the prediction models was measured by the correlation between predicted and observed yield employing two cross-validation schemes. The first modeled the prediction of hybrids when testcross data are available for both parental lines (type 2 hybrids), and the second modeled the prediction of hybrids when no testcross data for the parental lines were available (type 0 hybrids). MLR, SVM, and PLS resulted in a high correlation between predicted and observed yield for type 2 hybrids, whereas for type 0 hybrids DB had greater prediction accuracy. The regression methods were robust to the choice of the set of profiled genes and required only a few hundred genes. In contrast, for an accurate hybrid prediction with DB,~1,000\textendash 1,500 genes were required, and the prediction accuracy depended strongly on the set of profiled genes. We conclude that for prediction within one set of genetic material MLR is a promising approach, and for transfering prediction models from one set of genetic material to a related one, the transcriptome-based distance DB is most promising.},

  abstract = {Heterosis is observed for most phenotypic traits and developmental stages in many plants. In this study, the embryos, from germinating seeds after 24\,h of soaking, for five elite maize hybrids and their parents were selected to unravel the genetic basis of heterosis using 2-D proteomic method. In total, 257 (80.06\%), 363 (58.74\%), 351 (79.95\%), 242 (54.50\%), and 244 (46.30\%) nonadditively expressed proteins were identified in hybrids Zhengdan 958, Nongda 108, Yuyu 22, Xundan 20, and Xundan 18, respectively. The nonadditive proteins were divided into above high-parent (++; 811, 55.66\%), high-parent (+; 121, 8.30\%), partial dominance (+-; 249, 17.09\%), low-parent (-; 30, 2.06\%), below low-parent (- -; 62, 4.26\%), and D (different; 184, 12.63\%) expression patterns. The observed patterns indicate the important roles of dominance, partial dominance, and overdominance in regulating seed germination in maize. Additionally, 54 different proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and classified into nine functional groups: metabolism (9), cell detoxification (8), unknown functional proteins (8), chaperones (7), signal transduction (6), development process (5), other (5), transporter (3), and stress response (3). Of these, the most interesting are those involved with germination-related hormone signal transduction and the abscisic acid and gibberellin regulation networks.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely distributed and play essential roles in a series of developmental processes, although none have been identified or characterized in grapevines (Vitis vinifera). In this study, we characterized the function of grape circRNA and uncovered thousands of putative back-splicing sites by global transcriptome analysis. Our results indicated that several reported circRNA prediction algorithms should be used simultaneously to obtain comprehensive and reliable circRNA predictions in plants. Furthermore, the length of introns flanking grape circRNAs was closely related to exon circularization. Although the longer introns flanking grape circRNAs appeared to circularize more efficiently, a 20- to 50-nt region seemed large enough to drive grape circRNA biogenesis. In addition, the endogenous introns flanking circularized exon(s) in conjunction with reverse complementary sequences could support the accurate and efficient circularization of various exons in grape, which constitutes a new tool for exploring the functional consequences caused by circRNA expression. Finally, we identified 475 differentially expressed circRNAs in grape leaves under cold stress. Overexpression of Vv-circATS1, a circRNA derived from glycerol-3-P acyltransferase, improved cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), while the linear RNA derived from the same sequence cannot. These results indicate the functional difference between circRNA and linear RNA, and provide new insight into plant abiotic stress resistance.},

  abstract = {Lint percentage (LP) is an important yield component in cotton that is usually affected by initial fiber number and cell wall thickness. To explore how fiber cell wall development affects LP, phenotypic identification and dynamic transcriptome analysis were conducted using a single segment substitution line of chromosome 15 (SL15) that harbors a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for LP. Compared to its recurrent parent LMY22, SL15 did not differ in initial fiber number, but the fiber cell wall thickness and single-fiber weight decreased significantly, altering LP. The comparative transcriptome profiles revealed that the secondary cell wall (SCW) development phase of SL15 was relatively delayed. Meanwhile, the expression of genes related to cell expansion decreased more slightly in SL15 with fiber development, resulting in relatively higher expression at SL15\_25D than at LMY22\_25D. SCW development-related genes, such as GhNACs and GhMYBs, in the putative NAC-MYB-CESA network differentially expressed at SL15\_25D, along with the lower expression of CESA6, CSLC12, and CSLA2. The substituted chromosomal interval was further investigated, and found 6 of 146 candidate genes were differentially expressed in all four cell development periods including 10, 15, 20 and 25 DPA. Genetic variation and co-expression analysis showed that GH\_D01G0052, GH\_D01G0099, GH\_D01G0100, and GH\_D01G0140 may be important candidate genes associated with qLP-C15-1. Our results provide novel insights into cell wall development and its relationship with LP, which is beneficial for lint yield and fiber quality improvement.},

  abstract = {The individual effect of high temperatures or water-deficit stress on cotton has been studied extensively; however, their combined effects were less studied. To that end, an experiment was imposed with a heat-sensitive (Sumian 15) and a heat-tolerant (PHY370WR) cultivar in 2016\textendash 2018 and two temperature regimes including ambient temperature (AT, 31.0/26.4\textdegree C) and elevated temperature (ET, 33.4/28.9\textdegree C), and three soil relative water content (SRWC) levels including (75 {$\pm$} 5)\%, (60 {$\pm$} 5)\% and (45 {$\pm$} 5)\% were performed. Results showed that the decline in boll number was the primary driver of yield loss, while the decreases in boll weight minimally impacted yield under drought and combined treatments. Besides, elevated temperature and drought stress performed significant interactions on boll weight (except in 2018) and seed cotton yield (except for Sumian 15 in 2017). Specifically, seed cotton yield was reduced by 23\%\textendash 35\% in Sumian 15 and by 8\%\textendash 13\% in PHY370WR under ET60 (ET with SRWC (60 {$\pm$} 5)\%), while the reduction was 44\%\textendash 54\% in Sumian 15 and 37\%\textendash 43\% in PHY370WR under ET45 (ET with SRWC (45 {$\pm$} 5)\%), which produced lower yields than any other treatment combination or any single abiotic stress factor. Furthermore, significant interactions between the two stresses were observed in fibre length of Sumian 15 and strength (except for PHY370WR in 2018) and micronaire (except for Sumian 15 in 2017 and for PHY370WR in 2018) of both cultivars. Elevated temperature exacerbated the negative impacts of drought on fibre length but offset them on fibre strength and micronaire. Finally, the economic benefit among different treatments was evaluated. Compared to the control, ET45 suffered the biggest economic loss by 2,536.7 USD ha-2 in Sumian 15 and by 2,167.8 USD ha-2 in PHY370WR, respectively. Quantifying the interactive effects of drought and elevated temperature on cotton yield and fibre quality should allow researchers to better understand the economic implications of these two stresses which often occur concurrently under field conditions.},

Pathogen transmission occurs during blood feeding. Only the females blood feed as they require a bloodmeal for oogenesis; in the bloodmeal, holo-transferrin and hemoglobin provide the females with a high iron load. We are interested in the effects of the bloodmeal on the expression of iron-associated proteins in oogenesis. Previous data showed that following digestion of a bloodmeal, ovarian iron concentrations doubles by 72 hr. We have used shotgun proteomics to identify proteins expressed in Ae. aegypti ovaries at two oogenesis developmental stages following blood feeding, and tandem mass tag-labeling proteomics to quantify proteins expressed at one stage following feeding of a controlled iron diet. Our findings provide the first report of mosquito ovarian protein expression in early and late oogenesis. We identify proteins differentially expressed in the two oogenesis development stages. We establish that metal-associated proteins play an important role in Ae. aegypti oogenesis and we identify new candidate proteins that might be involved in mosquito iron metabolism. Finally, this work identified a unique second ferritin light chain subunit, the first reported in any species. The shotgun proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005893, while the tandem mass tag-labeled proteomic data are available with identifier PXD028242.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed non-coding RNAs that are usually derived from exonic regions of genes, but can also arise from intronic and intergenic regions. Studies of circRNAs in humans, animals and several plant species have shown an altered population of circRNAs in response to abiotic and biotic stress. Recently it was shown that circRNAs also occur in maize, but it is unknown if maize circRNAs are responsive to stress. Maize Iranian mosaic virus (MIMV, genus Nucleorhabdovirus, family Rhabdoviridae) causes an economically important disease in maize and other gramineous crops in Iran. In this study, we used data from RNA-Seq of MIMV-infected maize and uninfected controls to identify differentially expressed circRNAs. Such circRNAs were confirmed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, northern blot, RT-qPCR and sequencing. A total of 1443 circRNAs were identified in MIMV-infected maize and 1165 circRNAs in uninfected maize. Two hundred and one circRNAs were in common between MIMV-infected and uninfected samples. Of these, 155 circRNAs were up-regulated and 5 down-regulated in MIMV infected plants, compared to the uninfected control. This study for the first time identified and profiled circRNA expression in maize in response to virus infection. Moreover, we predict that 33 circRNAs may bind 23 maize miRNAs, possibly affecting plant metabolism and development. Our data suggest a role for circRNAs in plant cell regulation and response to biotic stress such as virus infection, and give new insights into the complexity of plant-microbe interactions.},

  abstract = {Hybrids are used extensively in agriculture due to their superior performance in seed yield and plant growth, yet the molecular mechanisms underpinning hybrid performance are not well understood. Recent evidence has suggested that a decrease in basal defense response gene expression regulated by reduced levels of salicylic acid (SA) may be important for vigor in certain hybrid combinations. Decreasing levels of SA in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accession C24 through the introduction of the SA catabolic enzyme salicylate1 hydroxylase (NahG) increases plant size, phenocopying the large-sized C24/Landsberg erecta (Ler) F1 hybrids. C24\venus{} \texttimes{} Ler\male{} F1 hybrids and C24 NahG lines shared differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with plant defense and leaf senescence including decreased expression of SA biosynthetic genes and SA response genes. The expression of TL1 BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1, a key regulator in resource allocation between growth and defense, was decreased in both the F1 hybrid and the C24 NahG lines, which may promote growth. Both C24 NahG lines and the F1 hybrids showed decreased expression of the key senescence-associated transcription factors WRKY53, NAC-CONTAINING PROTEIN29, and ORESARA1 with a delayed onset of senescence compared to C24 plants. The delay in senescence resulted in an extension of the photosynthetic period in the leaves of F1 hybrids compared to the parental lines, potentially allowing each leaf to contribute more resources toward growth.},

Epidermal cells differentiate into fiber cells approx. 3 d before anthesis. When ovules were cultured on a defined medium, fiber growth could be initiated on ovules any time between 2 d preanthesis and the time of anthesis by adding indole-3-acetic acid and gibberellic acid to the medium. In the absence of phytohormones, fibers did not grow, and when ovules between 2 d preanthesis and anthesis were cultured without hormones past the day of anthesis and hormones then added, most ovules failed to produce fibers. The results define the timing of fiber differentiation from epidermal cells, and also define a window of time when differentiated cells are capable of further development. During this window, fiber cells are latent awaiting appropriate stimulation which in the intact plant is apparently associated with anthesis.},

DNA methylation associated with 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs exhibits transallelic effects in hybrids of Arabidopsis and other species. Some of the transmethylation changes are inherited and some affect gene expression. Hybrids have larger leaves than those of the parents and have increases in cell size and number. The increased leaf size results in a greater photosynthetic capacity, which may support the increased vegetative and reproductive yields of the F1 hybrids. Genes and metabolic pathways that have altered expression relative to the parents include loci involved in responses to hormones and to biotic and abiotic stress. Whereas epigenetically induced changes in gene expression may contribute to hybrid vigor, the link between the transcriptional changes and the hybrid phenotype is not confirmed. Recurrent selection of high yielding F1 lines from the F2/F3 of a number of crops has fixed heterosis yields in pure breeding lines. These hybrid-like lines may have valuable applications in crop systems.},

However, transcriptome-scale networks tend to be highly connected, making it challenging for the hierarchical clustering underlying the WGCNA-based classification to discriminate coherently expressed gene sets without significant information loss from either a priori filtering of the expression dataset or a posteriori pruning of the cluster dendrogram. Here we present iterativeWGCNA, a Python-wrapped extension for the WGCNA R software package that improves the robustness of detected modules and minimizes information loss. The method works by pruning poorly fitting genes from estimated modules and then re-running WGCNA to refine gene clusters. After refining, pruned genes are assembled into a new expression dataset to isolate overlapping modules and the process repeated. In doing so, iterativeWGCNA provides an unsupervised, non-biased filtering to generate a robust, comprehensive network-based classification of whole-transcriptome expression datasets.},

Yield improvement has progressed slowly, especially in drought-prone regions where annual crop production suffers from episodic aridity. Underlying drought responses are circadian and diel control of gene expression that regulate daily variations in metabolic and physiological pathways. To identify transcriptomic changes that occur in the crop Brassica rapa during initial perception of drought, we applied a co-expression network approach to associate rhythmic gene expression changes with physiological responses. Coupled analysis of transcriptome and physiological parameters over a two-day time course in control and drought-stressed plants provided temporal resolution necessary for correlation of network modules with dynamic changes in stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate, and photosystem II efficiency. This approach enabled the identification of drought-responsive genes based on their differential rhythmic expression profiles in well-watered versus droughted networks and provided new insights into the dynamic physiological changes that occur during drought.},

However, derivatization protocols must also be developed if GC/MS (one of the mostly widely used analytical methods for metabolomics) is involved. The aim of this study was to investigate how different chemical and physical factors (extraction solvent, derivatization reagents, and temperature) affect the extraction and derivatization of the metabolome from leaves of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Using design of experiment procedures, variation was systematically introduced, and the effects of this variation were analyzed using regression models. The results show that this approach allows a reliable protocol for metabolomic analysis of Arabidopsis to be determined with a relatively limited number of experiments. Following two different investigations an extraction and derivatization protocol was chosen. Further, the reproducibility of the analysis of 66 endogenous compounds was investigated, and it was shown that both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds were detected with high reproducibility.},

Therefore, understanding the role of Ca2+ in carbon and lipid metabolism could provide insights into the dynamic changes of cell membranes and cell walls during rapid elongation of cotton fibers. In the present study, we found that the lack of Ca2+ promoted fiber elongation and ovule rapid expansion, but also caused tissue browning in ovule culture system. RNA-sequencing revealed that Ca2+ deficiency induced cells to be in a highly oxidized state, and the expression of genes related to carbon metabolism and lipid metabolism was activated significantly. All gene members of 9 key enzymes involving in glycolysis were up-regulated, and glucose was significantly reduced in Ca2+ deficiency treated tissues. Ca2+ deficiency adjusted the flowing of glycolysis metabolic. However, low K+ recovered the expression levels of glycolysis genes and glucose content caused by Ca2+ deficiency. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry technology was applied to uncover the dynamic profile of lipidome under Ca2+ and K+ interacted condition. Ca2+ deficiency led to the decrease of fatty acid (FA), diacylglycerol (DAG) and glycolipid, and the significant increase of triacylglycerol (TAG), phospholipid PE (phosphatidylethanolamine), PG (phosphatidylglycerol) and PC (phosphatidylcholine). Low K+ restored the contents of FA, phospholipids and glycolipids, effectively relieved the symptoms caused by Ca2+ deficiency, and recovered the development of fiber cells. This study revealed dynamic changes in transcript and metabolic levels, and uncovered the signaling interaction of Ca2+ deficiency and low K+ in glycolysis and lipid metabolism during fiber development.},

However, the current plant miRNA databases suffer from several typical drawbacks, including a lack of entries for many important species, uneven annotation standards across different species, abundant questionable entries, and limited annotation. To address these issues, we developed a knowledge-based database called Plant miRNA Encyclopedia (PmiREN, http://www.pmiren.com/), which was based on uniform processing of sequenced small RNA libraries using miRDeep-P2, followed by manual curation using newly updated plant miRNA identification criteria, and comprehensive annotation. PmiREN currently contains 16,422 high confidence novel miRNA loci in 88 plant species and 3,966 retrieved from miRBase. For every miRNA entry, information on precursor sequence, precursor secondary structure, expression pattern, clusters and synteny in the genome, potential targets supported by Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends (PARE) sequencing, and references is attached whenever possible. PmiREN is hierarchically accessible and has eight built-in search engines. We believe PmiREN is useful for plant miRNA cataloguing and data mining, therefore a resource for data-driven miRNA research in plants.},

  abstract = {AbstractGlucosinolates are sulfur-rich, anionic natural products that upon hydrolysis by endogenous thioglucosidases called myrosinases produce several different products (e.g., isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, and nitriles). The hydrolysis products have many different biological activities, e.g., as defense compounds and attractants. For humans these compounds function as cancer-preventing agents, biopesticides, and flavor compounds. Since the completion of the Arabidopsis genome, glucosinolate research has made significant progress, resulting in near-complete elucidation of the core biosynthetic pathway, identification of the first regulators of the pathway, metabolic engineering of specific glucosinolate profiles to study function, as well as identification of evolutionary links to related pathways. Although much has been learned in recent years, much more awaits discovery before we fully understand how and why plants synthesize glucosinolates. This may enable us to more fully exploit the potential of these compounds in agriculture and medicine.},

  abstract = {The p-value has long been the figurehead of statistical analysis in biology, but its position is under threat. p is now widely recognized as providing quite limited information about our data, and as being easily misinterpreted. Many biologists are aware of p's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the p-value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your p-value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar p-value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute p-values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the p-value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the p-value alone is not doing their data justice.},

  abstract = {The emerging recognition of the functional roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has given rise to a new perspective regarding our understanding of cellular physiology and disease pathogenesis. Unlike linear RNAs, circRNAs are covalently closed continuous loops that act as gene regulators in mammals, and their sequence composition determines the mode of circRNA biogenesis. The availability and integrated use of advanced genome analysis platforms have allowed the identification of a large number of these molecules. Their high abundance, stability and evolutionary conservation among species endow circRNAs with numerous potential functions, such as acting as microRNA (miRNA) sponges or binding to RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene transcription. Moreover, circRNAs have been shown to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner and in pathological conditions, which has stimulated significant interest in their role in human disease and cancer. In this concise review, we outline the characteristics, functions and mechanisms of action of circRNAs as well as their involvement in different diseases. Although their exact roles and mechanisms of gene regulation remain to be clarified, circRNAs have potential applications as disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets.},

However, difficulty in accurate and high-throughput functional analysis of human gut microorganisms has hindered efforts to define mechanistic connections between individual microbial strains and host phenotypes. One key way in which the gut microbiome influences host physiology is through the production of small molecules1-3, yet progress in elucidating this chemical interplay has been hindered by limited tools calibrated to detect the products of anaerobic biochemistry in the gut. Here we construct a microbiome-focused, integrated mass-spectrometry pipeline to accelerate the identification of microbiota-dependent metabolites in diverse sample types. We report the metabolic profiles of 178 gut microorganism strains using our library of 833 metabolites. Using this metabolomics resource, we establish deviations in the relationships between phylogeny and metabolism, use machine learning to discover a previously undescribed~type of metabolism in Bacteroides,~and reveal candidate biochemical pathways using comparative genomics. Microbiota-dependent metabolites can be detected in diverse biological fluids from gnotobiotic and conventionally colonized mice and traced back to the corresponding metabolomic profiles of cultured bacteria. Collectively, our microbiome-focused metabolomics pipeline and interactive metabolomics profile explorer are a powerful tool for characterizing microorganisms and interactions between microorganisms and their host.},

  abstract = {The FERONIA (FER) signaling pathway is known to have diverse roles in Arabidopsis thaliana, such as growth, reproduction, and defense, but how this receptor kinase is involved in various biological processes is not well established. In this work, we applied multiple mass spectrometry techniques to identify metabolites involved in the FER signaling pathway and to understand their biological roles. A direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)-MS approach was used for initial screening of wild-type and feronia (fer) mutant plant extracts, and Arabidopsides were found to be significantly enriched in the mutant. As Arabidopsides are known to be induced by wounding, further experiments on wounded and non-wounded leaf samples were carried out to investigate these oxylipins as well as related phytohormones using a quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS by direct injection and LC-MS/MS. In a root growth bioassay with Arabidopside A isolated from fer mutants, the wild-type showed significant root growth inhibition compared with the fer mutant. Our results therefore implicated Arabidopsides, and Arabidopside A specifically, in FER functions and/or signaling. Finally, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to visualize the localization of Arabidopsides, and we confirmed that Arabidopsides are highly abundant at wounding sites in both wild-type and fer mutant leaves. More significantly, five micron high-spatial resolution MALDI-MSI revealed that Arabidopsides are localized to the chloroplasts where many stress signaling molecules are made.},

One large subgroup of non-coding RNAs is the recently discovered class of circular RNAs (circRNAs). CircRNAs are conserved and expressed in a tissue and developmental specific manner, although for the vast majority, the functional relevance remains unclear. To identify and quantify circRNAs expression, several bioinformatic pipelines have been developed to assess the catalog of circRNAs in any given total RNA sequencing dataset. We recently compared five different algorithms for circRNA detection, but here this analysis is extended to 11 algorithms. By comparing the number of circRNAs discovered and their respective sensitivity to RNaseR digestion, the sensitivity and specificity of each algorithm are evaluated. Moreover, the ability to predict de novo circRNA, i.e., circRNAs not derived from annotated splice sites, is also determined as well as the effect of eliminating low quality and adaptor-containing reads prior to circRNA prediction. Finally, and most importantly, all possible pair-wise combinations of algorithms are tested and guidelines for algorithm complementarity are provided. Conclusively, the algorithms mostly agree on highly expressed circRNAs, however, in many cases, algorithm-specific false positives with high read counts are predicted, which is resolved by using the shared output from two (or more) algorithms.},

As with the two previous vo1umes, this one is entire1y se1f-contained and where necessary tabu1ar data and references from earlier vo1umes are included and expanded here. A unique feature is the complete listing in the Appendix ofall known flavonoids, which now number over 4000 structures; in this list, structures newly reported during the period 1981-1985 are so indicated. The first ten chaptersofthis book provide a critical review ofthe new substancesthat have been discovered among each of the main classes of flavonoid during the period under review. Again, the numberofnew isoflavonoids reported outweighs that ofother classesand ahundred pagesare needed to describe all the nove1 findings. Neoflavonoids, which were omitted in the first supplement, have been included again and a special chapter on miscellaneous flavonoids has been introduced to cope with those structures (e.g. homoisoflavonoids) which do not fit in easily anywhere else. Although there have been advances in flavonoid methodology, these have not been asspectacular as in earlier years. Hence, literature reports on new chromatographic and spectral procedures are included here in the individual chapters under the different flavonoid classes.},

Plants under induced stress resulting from competition may alter their metabolome to increase their resilience or enhance their defense mechanisms. In the present study, rye (Secale cereale) plants were cocultivated with different densities (3, 12, and 18 plants per pot) of Austrian pea (Pisum sativum subsp. arvense), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), and Alexandrian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) to elucidate the changes in the rye metabolome in response to the different levels of competition. Global metabolic profiling by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS), liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS), and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) was performed on rye plants, and the acquired data were analyzed using uni- and multivariate statistics. Targeted analysis showed that a high level of competition reduced the concentration of aglycone benzoxazinoids (BXs) and increased glycoside BXs in rye roots. Untargeted metabolomics analysis indicated an increase in the rye root content of the allelopathic compounds 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and uracil in response to competition. Untargeted analysis of rye shoots revealed that the plant competition increased the d-pyroglutamic acid, which is an elicitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Mapping of the casual mutation revealed that rimb6 carries a single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED (PR) GENES 1, CPR1 (At4g12560), leading to a premature stop codon. CPR1 is known as a repressor of pathogen signaling and regulator of microtubule organization. Allelism of rimb6 and cpr1 revealed a function of CPR1 in chloroplast stress protection. Expression studies in pathogen signaling mutants demonstrated that CPR1-mediated activation of genes for photosynthesis and chloroplast antioxidant protection is, in contrast to activation of pathogen responses, regulated independently from PAD4-controlled salicylic acid (SA) accumulation. We conclude that the support of plastid function is a basic, SA-independent function of CPR1.},

We further revealed that the haplotypic diversity originated from landraces, which might be essential for understanding adaptative evolution in cultivated cotton. Introgression and association analyses identified new fiber quality-related loci and demonstrated that the introgressed alleles from two diploid cottons had a large effect on fiber quality improvement. These loci provided the potential power to overcome the bottleneck in fiber quality improvement.

  abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a fatal gynecologic cancer, and its poor prognosis is mainly due to delayed diagnosis. Therefore, biomarker identification and prognosis prediction are crucial in EOC. Altered cell metabolism is a characteristic feature of cancers, and metabolomics reflects an individual's current phenotype. In particular, plasma metabolome analyses can be useful for biomarker identification. In this study, we analyzed 624 metabolites, including uremic toxins (UTx) in plasma derived from 80 patients with EOC using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Compared with the healthy control, we detected 77 significantly increased metabolites and 114 significantly decreased metabolites in EOC patients. Especially, decreased concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylcholines and increased concentrations of triglycerides were observed, indicating a metabolic profile characteristic of EOC patients. After calculating the parameters of each metabolic index, we found that higher ratios of kynurenine to tryptophan correlates with worse prognosis in EOC patients. Kynurenine, one of the UTx, can affect the prognosis of EOC. Our results demonstrated that plasma metabolome analysis is useful not only for the diagnosis of EOC, but also for predicting prognosis with the variation of UTx and evaluating response to chemotherapy.},

In recent years proteomics has been intensively applied to identify proteins involved in shaping the three-dimensional architecture and regulating the function of the maize root system. With the help of developmental mutants, proteomic changes during the initiation and emergence of shoot-borne, lateral and seminal roots have been examined. Furthermore, root hairs were surveyed to understand the proteomic changes during the elongation of these single cell type structures. In addition, primary roots have been used to study developmental changes of the proteome but also to investigate the proteomes of distinct tissues such as the meristematic zone, the elongation zone as well as stele and cortex of the differentiation zone. Moreover, subcellular fractions of the primary root including cell walls, plasma membranes and secreted mucilage have been analyzed. Finally, the superior vigor of hybrid seedling roots compared to their parental inbred lines was studied on the proteome level. In summary, these studies provide novel insights into the complex proteomic interactions of the elaborate maize root system during development.},

The genome sequence of the reference genotype, B73, representative of the stiff stalk heterotic group was recently updated (AGPv4) using long-read sequencing and optical mapping technology. To facilitate the use of AGPv4 and to enable functional genomic studies and association of genotype with phenotype, we determined expression abundances for replicated mRNA-sequencing datasets from 79 tissues and five abiotic/biotic stress treatments revealing 36~207 expressed genes. Characterization of the B73 transcriptome across six organs revealed 4154 organ-specific and 7704 differentially expressed (DE) genes following stress treatment. Gene co-expression network analyses revealed 12 modules associated with distinct biological processes containing 13~590 genes providing a resource for further association of gene function based on co-expression patterns. Presence-absence variants (PAVs) previously identified using whole genome resequencing data from 61 additional inbred lines were enriched in organ-specific and stress-induced DE genes suggesting that PAVs may function in phenological variation and adaptation to environment. Relative to core genes conserved across the 62 profiled inbreds, PAVs have lower expression abundances which are correlated with their frequency of dispersion across inbreds and on average have significantly fewer co-expression network connections suggesting that a subset of PAVs may be on an evolutionary path to pseudogenization. To facilitate use by the community, we developed the Maize Genomics Resource website (maize.plantbiology.msu.edu) for viewing and data-mining these resources and deployed two new views on the maize electronic Fluorescent Pictograph Browser (bar.utoronto.ca/efp\_maize).},

They are found mainly in the family Brassicaceae, which includes several important crops. More than 120 different glucosinolates are known. The enzyme myrosinase, which is stored in specialized plant cells, converts glucosinolates to the toxic isothiocyanates. Insect herbivores may reduce the toxicity of glucosinolates and their products by excretion, detoxification, or behavioral adaptations. Glucosinolates also affect higher trophic levels, via reduced host or prey quality or because specialist herbivores may sequester glucosinolates for their own defense. There is substantial quantitative and qualitative variation between plant genotypes, tissues, and ontogenetic stages, which poses specific challenges to insect herbivores. Even though glucosinolates are constitutive defenses, their levels are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors including insect damage. Plant breeders may use knowledge on glucosinolates to increase insect resistance in Brassica crops. State-of-the-art techniques, such as mutant analysis and metabolomics, are necessary to identify the exact role of glucosinolates.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) as well as class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) are evolutionarily conserved membrane tethering complexes that play important roles in lysosomal/vacuolar trafficking. Whether HOPS and CORVET control endomembrane trafficking in pollen tubes, the fastest growing plant cells, remains largely elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the four core components shared by the two complexes, Vacuole protein sorting 11 (VPS11), VPS16, VPS33, and VPS18, are all essential for pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis thaliana and thus for plant reproduction success. We used VPS18 as a representative core component of the complexes to show that the protein is localized to both multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the tonoplast in a growing pollen tube. Mutant vps18 pollen tubes grew more slowly in vivo, resulting in a significant reduction in male transmission efficiency. Additional studies revealed that membrane fusion from MVBs to vacuoles is severely compromised in vps18 pollen tubes, corroborating the function of VPS18 in late endocytic trafficking. Furthermore, vps18 pollen tubes produce excessive exocytic vesicles at the apical zone and excessive amounts of pectin and pectin methylesterases in the cell wall. In conclusion, this study establishes an additional conserved role of HOPS/CORVET in homotypic membrane fusion during vacuole biogenesis in pollen tubes and reveals a feedback regulation of HOPS/CORVET in the secretion of cell wall modification enzymes of rapidly growing plant cells.},

  abstract = {Cotton ranks among the world's important oilseed crops, yet relative to other oilseeds there are few studies of oil-related biosynthetic and regulatory pathways. We present global transcriptome analyses of cotton seed development using RNA-seq and four developmental time-points. Because Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an allopolyploid containing two genomes (A/D), we partitioned expression into the individual contributions of each homeologous gene copy. Data were explored with respect to genic and subgenomic patterns of expression, globally and with respect to seed pathways and networks. The most dynamic period of transcriptome change is from 20-30 d postanthesis (DPA), with about 20\% of genes showing homeolog expression bias. Co-expression analysis shows largely congruent homeolog networks, but also homeolog-specific divergence. Functional enrichment tests show that flavonoid biosynthesis and lipid related genes were significantly represented early and later in seed development, respectively. An involvement of new features in oil biosynthesis was found, like the contribution of DGAT3 (diacylglycerol acyltransferase) to the total triglyceride expression pool. Also, catechin-based and epicatechin-based proanthocyanidin expression are reciprocally biased with respect to homeolog usage. This study provides the first temporal analysis of duplicated gene expression in cotton seed and a resource for understanding new aspects of oil and flavonoid biosynthetic processes.},

Transcriptomic responses to genomic merger and doubling have been demonstrated in many allopolyploid systems, encompassing a diversity of phenomena including homoeolog expression bias, genome dominance, expression-level dominance and revamping of co-expression networks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there remains a need to develop a conceptual framework that will stimulate a deeper understanding of these diverse phenomena and their mechanistic interrelationships. Here we introduce considerations relevant to this framework with a focus on cis-trans interactions among duplicated genes and alleles in hybrids and allopolyploids. By extending classic allele-specific expression analysis to the allopolyploid level, we distinguish the distinct effects of progenitor regulatory interactions from the novel intergenomic interactions that arise from genome merger and allopolyploidization. This perspective informs experiments designed to reveal the molecular genetic basis of gene regulatory control, and will facilitate the disentangling of genetic from epigenetic and higher-order effects that impact gene expression. Finally, we suggest that the extended cis-trans model may help conceptually unify several presently disparate hallmarks of allopolyploid evolution, including genome-wide expression dominance and biased fractionation, and lead to a new level of understanding of phenotypic novelty accompanying polyploidy.},

  abstract = {An a-maize-ing set of genomes Maize is an important crop that is cultivated worldwide. As maize spread across the world, selection for local environments resulted in variation, but the impact on differences between the genome has not been quantified. By producing high-quality genomic sequences of the 26 lines used in the maize nested association mapping panel, Hufford et al. map important traits and demonstrate the diversity of maize. Examining RNA and methylation of genes across accessions, the authors identified a core set of maize genes. Beyond this core set, comparative analysis across lines identified high levels of variation in the total set of genes, the maize pan-genome. The value of this resource was further exemplified by mapping quantitative traits of interest, including those related to pathogen resistance. Science, abg5289, this issue p. 655 We report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population. The number of pan-genes in these diverse genomes exceeds 103,000, with approximately a third found across all genotypes. The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies. We also document variation at the level of DNA methylation and demonstrate that unmethylated regions are enriched for cis-regulatory elements that contribute to phenotypic variation. A multigenome analysis of maize reveals variation in gene content, genome structure, and methylation.

In theory, all epidermal cells have the potential to develop into fibers, but only 15\%\textendash 25\% of epidermis cells develop into commercially viable lint fibers. We previously showed that GhLac1 participates in cotton defense against biotic stress. Here we report that GhLac1 also has a role in cotton fiber development. GhLac1 RNAi lines in cotton showed increased differentiation of fiber initials from epidermis and shortened fiber length, resulting in unchanged lint percentage. Suppression of GhLac1 expression led to constitutively hyperaccumulated jasmonic acid (JA) and flavonoids in ovules and fiber cells. In vitro ovule culture experiments confirmed the distinct roles of JA and flavonoids in fiber initiation and elongation, and showed that fiber development is spatially regulated by these chemicals: the increased fiber initiation in GhLac1 RNAi lines is caused by hyperaccumulated JA and rutin content during the fiber initiation stage and shortened fiber length is caused by constitutively increased JA and naringenin content during the fiber elongation stage.},

Maize is the most successful crop in utilizing heterosis. The development of hybrid maize ears exhibits strong heterotic vigor and greatly affects maize yield. However, a comprehensive perspective on transcriptional variation and its correlation with heterosis during maize ear development is not available. RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing technology, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of maize ears in the spikelet and floret differentiation stages of hybrid ZD808 and its parents CL11 and NG5. Our results revealed that 53.9\% (21,258) of maize protein-coding genes were transcribed in at least one genotype. In both development stages, significant numbers of genes were differentially expressed between the hybrid and its parents. Gene expression inheritance analysis revealed approximately 80\% of genes were expressed additively, which suggested that the complementary effect may play a foundation role in maize ear heterosis. Among non-additively expressed genes, NG5-dominant genes were predominant. Analyses of the allele-specific gene expression in hybrid identified pervasive allelic imbalance and significant preferential expression of NG5 alleles in both developmental stages. The results implied that NG5 may provide beneficial alleles that contribute greatly to heterosis. Further comparison of parental and hybrid allele-specific expression suggested that gene expression variation is largely attributable to cis-regulatory variation in maize. The cis-regulatory variations tend to preserve the allelic expression levels in hybrid and result in additive expression. Comparison between the two development stages revealed that allele-specific expression and cis-/trans-regulatory variations responded differently to developmental cues, which may lead to stage-specific vigor phenotype during maize ear development. CONCLUSION: Our research suggests that cis-regulated additive expression may fine-tune gene expression level into an optimal status and play a foundation role in maize ear heterosis.

  abstract = {Cotton fibre is an important natural fibre for the textile industry. The number of fibre initials determines the lint percentage, which is an important factor for cotton fibre yield. Although fibre development has been described by transcriptomic analysis, the mechanism by which the long noncoding RNA manipulates the initiation of lint and fuzz fibres remains unknown. In this study, three lines with different lint percentages were developed by crossing Xu142 with its fibreless mutant Xu142~fl. We collected the epidermal cells from the ovules with attached fibres at 0 and 5~days post anthesis (DPA) from Xu142, the fibreless mutant Xu142~fl and the three lint percent diversified lines for deep transcriptome sequencing. A total of 2641 novel genes, 35~802 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 2262 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were identified, of which 645 lncRNAs were preferentially expressed in the fibreless mutant Xu142~fl and 651 lncRNAs were preferentially expressed in the fibre-attached lines. We demonstrated the functional roles of the three lncRNAs in fibre development via a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system. Our results showed that silencing XLOC\_545639 and XLOC\_039050 in Xu142~fl increased the number of fibre initials on the ovules, but silencing XLOC\_079089 in Xu142 resulted in a short fibre phenotype. This study established the transcriptomic repertoires in cotton fibre initiation and provided evidence for the potential functions of lncRNAs in fibre development.},

F-box proteins are key components of the ubiquitin proteasome system that allows targeted protein degradation. Transcriptome analyses indicate that half of these F-box protein genes are found expressed in microspore and/or pollen, i.e., during male gametogenesis. To assess the role of F-box protein genes during this crucial developmental step, we selected 34 F-box protein genes recorded as highly and specifically expressed in pollen and isolated corresponding insertion mutants. We checked the expression level of each selected gene by RT-PCR and confirmed pollen expression for 25 genes, but specific expression for only 10 of the 34 F-box protein genes. In addition, we tested the expression level of selected F-box protein genes in 24 mutant lines and showed that 11 of them were null mutants. Transmission analysis of the mutations to the progeny showed that none of the single mutations was gametophytic lethal. These unaffected transmission efficiencies suggested leaky mutations or functional redundancy among F-box protein genes. Cytological observation of the gametophytes in the mutants confirmed these results. Combinations of mutations in F-box protein genes from the same subfamily did not lead to transmission defect either, further highlighting functional redundancy and/or a high proportion of pseudogenes among these F-box protein genes.},

The results showed that moderate to high N levels had significantly improved growth, photosynthesis, and sucrose content of CCRI-69 as compared to XLZ-30. The seed cotton yield and lint yield of CCRI-69 were similar under moderate and high N levels but higher than XLZ-30. Similarly, moderate to high N levels improved the C/N metabolizing enzymatic activities in the subtending leaf of CCRI-69 than XLZ-30. A strong correlation was found between subtending leaf N concentration with C/N metabolizing enzymes, photosynthesis, sucrose contents, boll weight, and seed cotton yield of N-efficient cotton genotype. These findings suggest that subtending leaf N concentration regulates the enzymatic activities and has a key role in improving the yield. These parameters may be considered for breeding N-efficient cotton genotypes, which might help to reduce fertilizer loss and improve crop productivity.},

  abstract = {Flavonols are colourless secondary metabolites, primarily regarded as UV-protection pigments that are deposited in plants in their glycosylated forms. The glycosylation of flavonols is mainly catalysed by UDP-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Although the structures of flavonol glycosides accumulating in Arabidopsis thaliana are known, many genes involved in the flavonol glycosylation pathway are yet to be discovered. The flavonol glycoside profiles of seedlings from 81 naturally occurring A. thaliana accessions were screened using high performance thin layer chromatography. A qualitative variation in flavonol 3-O-gentiobioside 7-O-rhamnoside (F3GG7R) content was identified. Ler \texttimes{} Col-0 recombinant inbred line mapping and whole genome association mapping led to the identification of a glycoside hydrolase family 1-type gene, At1g60270/BGLU6, that encodes a homolog of acyl-glucose-dependent glucosyltransferases involved in the glycosylation of anthocyanins, possibly localized in the cytoplasm, and that is co-expressed with genes linked to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. A causal single nucleotide polymorphism introducing a premature stop codon in non-producer accessions was found to be absent in the producers. Several other naturally occurring loss-of-function alleles were also identified. Two independent bglu6 T-DNA insertion mutants from the producer accessions showed loss of F3GG7R. Furthermore, bglu6 mutant lines complemented with the genomic Ler BGLU6 gene confirmed that BGLU6 is essential for production of F3GGR7. We have thus identified an accession-specific gene that causes a qualitative difference in flavonol glycoside accumulation in A. thaliana strains. This gene encodes a flavonol 3-O-glucoside: 6{${''}$}-O-glucosyltransferase that does not belong to the large canonical family of flavonol glycosyltransferases that use UDP-conjugates as the activated sugar donor substrate.},

To address this question, plant cells provide a system suitable for live-imaging approaches because individual Golgi stacks are well separated in the cytoplasm. We established tobacco BY-2 cell lines expressing multiple Golgi markers tagged by different fluorescent proteins and observed their responses to brefeldin A (BFA) treatment and BFA removal. BFA treatment disrupted cis, medial, and trans cisternae but caused distinct relocalization patterns depending on the proteins examined. Medial- and trans-Golgi proteins, as well as one cis-Golgi protein, were absorbed into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but two other cis-Golgi proteins formed small punctate structures. After BFA removal, these puncta coalesced first, and then the Golgi stacks regenerated from them in the cis-to-trans order. We suggest that these structures have a property similar to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and function as the scaffold of Golgi regeneration.},

  abstract = {Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important carotenoid-derived phytohormone that plays essential roles in plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as in various physiological and developmental processes. In Arabidopsis, ABA biosynthesis starts with the epoxidation of zeaxanthin by the ABA DEFICIENT 1 (ABA1) enzyme, leading to epoxycarotenoids; e.g., violaxanthin. The oxidative cleavage of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoids, a key regulatory step catalyzed by 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE, forms xanthoxin, which is converted in further reactions mediated by ABA DEFICIENT 2 (ABA2), ABA DEFICIENT 3 (ABA3), and ABSCISIC ALDEHYDE OXIDASE 3 (AAO3) into ABA. By combining genetic and biochemical approaches, we unravel here an ABA1-independent ABA biosynthetic pathway starting upstream of zeaxanthin. We identified the carotenoid cleavage products~(i.e., apocarotenoids, {$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal, 9-cis-{$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal, 3-OH-{$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal, and 9-cis-3-OH-{$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal) as intermediates of this ABA1-independent ABA biosynthetic pathway. Using labeled compounds, we showed that {$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal, 9-cis-{$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal, and 3-OH-{$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal are successively converted into 9-cis-3-OH-{$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenal, xanthoxin, and finally into ABA in both Arabidopsis and rice. When applied to Arabidopsis, these {$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenoids exert ABA biological functions, such as maintaining seed dormancy and inducing the expression of ABA-responsive genes. Moreover, the transcriptomic analysis revealed a high overlap of differentially expressed genes regulated by {$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenoids and ABA, suggesting that {$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenoids exert ABA-independent regulatory activities. Taken together, our study identifies a biological function for the common plant metabolites, {$\beta$}-apo-11-carotenoids, extends our knowledge about ABA biosynthesis, and provides new insights into plant apocarotenoid metabolic networks.},

By screening known and assumed carotenoid derivatives, we identified anchorene, a presumed carotenoid-derived dialdehyde (diapocarotenoid), as the specific signal needed for ANR formation. We demonstrate that anchorene is an Arabidopsis metabolite and that its exogenous application rescues the ANR phenotype in carotenoid-deficient plants and promotes the growth of normal seedlings. Nitrogen deficiency resulted in enhanced anchorene content and an increased number of ANRs, suggesting a role of this nutrient in determining anchorene content and ANR formation. Transcriptome analysis and treatment of auxin reporter lines indicate that anchorene triggers ANR formation by modulating auxin homeostasis. Together, our work reveals a growth regulator with potential application to agriculture and a new carotenoid-derived signaling molecule.},

  abstract = {F-box-containing proteins, as the key components of the protein degradation machinery, are widely distributed in higher plants and are considered as one of the largest known families of regulatory proteins. The F-box protein family plays a crucial role in plant growth and development and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, systematic analysis of the F-box family in maize (Zea mays) has not been reported yet. In this paper, we identified and characterised the maize F-box genes in a genome-wide scale, including phylogenetic analysis, chromosome distribution, gene structure, promoter analysis and gene expression profiles. A total of 359 F-box genes were identified and divided into 15 subgroups by phylogenetic analysis. The F-box domain was relatively conserved, whereas additional motifs outside the F-box domain may indicate the functional diversification of maize F-box genes. These genes were unevenly distributed in ten maize chromosomes, suggesting that they expanded in the maize genome because of tandem and segmental duplication events. The expression profiles suggested that the maize F-box genes had temporal and spatial expression patterns. Putative cis-acting regulatory DNA elements involved in abiotic stresses were observed in maize F-box gene promoters. The gene expression profiles under abiotic stresses also suggested that some genes participated in stress responsive pathways. Furthermore, ten genes were chosen for quantitative real-time PCR analysis under drought stress and the results were consistent with the microarray data. This study has produced a comparative genomics analysis of the maize ZmFBX gene family that can be used in further studies to uncover their roles in maize growth and development.},

  abstract = {Carotenoid-derived regulatory metabolites and hormones are generally known to arise through the oxidative cleavage of a single double bond in the carotenoid backbone, which yields mono-carbonyl products called apocarotenoids. However, the extended conjugated double bond system of these pigments predestines them also to repeated cleavage forming dialdehyde products, diapocarotenoids, which have been less investigated due to their instability and low abundance. Recently, we reported on the short diapocarotenoid anchorene as an endogenous Arabidopsis metabolite and specific signaling molecule that promotes anchor root formation. In this work, we investigated the biological activity of a synthetic isomer of anchorene, iso-anchorene, which can be derived from repeated carotenoid cleavage. We show that iso-anchorene is a growth inhibitor that specifically inhibits primary root growth by reducing cell division rates in the root apical meristem. Using auxin efflux transporter marker lines, we also show that the effect of iso-anchorene on primary root growth involves the modulation of auxin homeostasis. Moreover, by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrate that iso-anchorene is a natural Arabidopsis metabolite. Chemical inhibition of carotenoid biosynthesis led to a significant decrease in the iso-anchorene level, indicating that it originates from this metabolic pathway. Taken together, our results reveal a novel carotenoid-derived regulatory metabolite with a specific biological function that affects root growth, manifesting the biological importance of diapocarotenoids.},

The AP2/ERF superfamily members are involved in regulating flower and seed development in many species, and therefore play key roles in seed yield. However, it is still unknown that how many AP2/ERF members were presented in the \emph{G. max} genome and whether these AP2/ERF family members function in flower and seed development in \emph{G. max}. Here, we identified 380 AP2/ERF superfamily genes in the \emph{G. max} genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 323 members were grouped into the ERF family, and 49 into the AP2 family. Among the AP2 family, 14 members of the euAP2 lineage showed high identity with their orthologs, and eight member of the ANT lineage were expressed highly in the seeds. Furthermore, seven of them (\emph{GmAP2-1} to \emph{GmAP2-7}) were successfully cloned and over-expressed in \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana}. The transgenic \emph{Arabidopsis} plants over-expressing these \emph{GmAP2} genes flowered earlier relative to the wild type control.

Phospholipase A1 (ZmPLA1)/NOT LIKE DAD (NLD)/MATRILINEAL (MTL) is a key gene controlling HI in maize; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.

Functional classes of significantly enriched or differentially abundant molecular entities were found to be associated with the oxidative stress response, suggesting that a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst plays a critical role in HI. In support of this, we further discovered that a simple chemical treatment of pollen with ROS reagents could lead to HI. Moreover, we identified ZmPOD65, which encodes a sperm-specific peroxidase, as a new gene controlling HI. Taken together, our study revealed a likely mechanism of HI, discovered a new gene controlling HI, and created a new method for HI in maize, indicating the importance of ROS balance in maintaining normal reproduction and providing a potential route to accelerate crop breeding.},

Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB resensitizes both early resistant cell cultures and primary leukemia cells from gilteritinib-treated AML patients. These findings support a combinatorial strategy to target early resistant AML cells with AURKB inhibitors and gilteritinib before the expansion of pre-existing resistance mutations occurs.},

These results indicate that {$\beta$}-glycerophosphatase activity was associated with differentiating fiber cells, specifically with those sites where distinct anatomical, and perhaps catabolic, changes were occurring. The significance of the results is discussed in relation to possible mechanisms of cotton fiber differentiation.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs play a key role in the control of plant development and response to adverse environmental conditions. For example, microRNA395 (miR395), which targets three out of four isoforms of ATP sulfurylase, the first enzyme of sulfate assimilation, as well as a low-affinity sulfate transporter, SULTR2;1, is strongly induced by sulfate deficiency. However, other components of sulfate assimilation are induced by sulfate starvation, so that the role of miR395 is counterintuitive. Here, we describe the regulation of miR395 and its targets by sulfate starvation. We show that miR395 is important for the increased translocation of sulfate to the shoots during sulfate starvation. MiR395 together with the SULFUR LIMITATION 1 transcription factor maintain optimal levels of ATP sulfurylase transcripts to enable increased flux through the sulfate assimilation pathway in sulfate-deficient plants. Reduced expression of ATP sulfurylase (ATPS) alone affects both sulfate translocation and flux, but SULTR2;1 is important for the full rate of sulfate translocation to the shoots. Thus, miR395 is an integral part of the regulatory circuit controlling plant sulfate assimilation with a complex mechanism of action.},

  abstract = {Roots are important plant organs for the uptake of water and nutrient elements. Plant root development is finely regulated by endogenous signals and environmental cues, which shapes the root system architecture to optimize the plant growth and adapt to the rhizospheric environments. Carotenoids are precursors of plant hormones strigolactones (SLs) and ABA, as well as multiple bioactive molecules. Numerous studies have demonstrated SLs and ABA as essential regulators of plant root growth and development. In addition, a lot carotenoid-derived bioactive metabolites are recently identified as plant root growth regulators, such as anchorene, {$\beta$}-cyclocitral, retinal and zaxinone. However, our knowledge on how these metabolites affect the root architecture to cope with various stressors and how they interact with each other during these processes is still quite limited. In the present review, we will briefly introduce the biosynthesis of carotenoid-derived root regulators and elaborate their biological functions on root development and architecture, focusing on their contribution to the rhizospheric environmental adaption of plants.},

However, for genetic improvement to be achieved, a solid understanding of the physiological and biochemical changes in plants induced by PGPR and PGR is required. The present study was carried out to investigate the role of PGPR and PGRs on the physiology and biochemical changes in chickpea grown under drought stress conditions and their association with drought tolerance. The PGPR, isolated from the rhizosphere of chickpea, were characterized on the basis of colony morphology and biochemical characters. They were also screened for the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ammonia (NH3), and exopolysaccharides (EPS) production. The isolated PGPR strains, named P1, P2, and P3, were identified by 16S-rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus megaterium, respectively. The seeds of two chickpea varieties, Punjab Noor-2009 (drought sensitive) and 93127 (drought tolerant) were soaked for 2\textendash 3\,h prior to sowing in 24\,h old cultures of isolates. The salicylic acid (SA) and putrescine (Put) were sprayed (150\,mg/L) on 25\,day old chickpea seedlings. The results showed that chickpea plants treated with a consortium of PGPR and PGRs significantly enhanced the chlorophyll, protein, and sugar contents compared to irrigated and drought conditions. Leaf proline content, lipid peroxidation, and activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APOX, POD, and SOD) all increased in response to drought stress but decreased due to the PGPR and PGRs treatment. An ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) analysis was carried out for metabolic profiling of chickpea leaves planted under controlled (well-irrigated), drought, and consortium (drought plus PGPR and PGRs) conditions. Proline, L-arginine, L-histidine, L-isoleucine, and tryptophan were accumulated in the leaves of chickpea exposed to drought stress. Consortium of PGPR and PGRs induced significant accumulation of riboflavin, L-asparagine, aspartate, glycerol, nicotinamide, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutarate in the leaves of chickpea. The drought sensitive chickpea variety showed significant accumulation of nicotinamide and 4-hydroxy-methylglycine in PGPR and PGR treated plants at both time points (44 and 60 days) as compared to non-inoculated drought plants. Additionally, arginine accumulation was also enhanced in the leaves of the sensitive variety under drought conditions. Metabolic changes as a result of drought and consortium conditions highlighted pools of metabolites that affect the metabolic and physiological adjustments in chickpea that reduce drought impacts.},

The process of attachment of the agrobacteria to plant cells and the transport of T-DNA into the cell and further to the nucleus has been well described. However, the exact mechanism of integration into the host's DNA is still unclear, although several models have been proposed. During confirmation of T-DNA insertion alleles from the GABI-Kat collection of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, we have generated about 34~000 sequences from the junctions between inserted T-DNA and adjacent genome regions. Here, we describe the evaluation of this dataset with regard to existing models for T-DNA integration. The results suggest that integration into the plant genome is mainly mediated by the endogenous plant DNA repair machinery. The observed integration events showed characteristics highly similar to those of repair sites of double-strand breaks with respect to microhomology and deletion sizes. In addition, we describe unexpected integration events, such as large deletions and inversions at the integration site that are relevant for correct interpretation of results from T-DNA insertion mutants in reverse genetics experiments.},

  abstract = {Plant cell walls play a fundamental role in several ways, providing structural support for cells, resistance against pathogens and facilitating the communication between cells. The glycosyltransferase family 8 (GT8) is involved in the formation of the plant cell wall. However, the evolutionary relationship and the functional differentiation of this important gene family remain obscure in Gramineae crop genomes. In the present investigation, we identified 269 GT8 genes in the seven Gramineae representative crop genomes, namely, 33 in Hordeum vulgare, 37 in Brachypodium distachyon, 40 in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica, 41 in Oryza rufipogon, 36 in Setaria italica, 37 in Sorghum bicolor, and 45 in Zea mays. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that all identified GT8 proteins belonged to seven subfamilies: galacturonosyltransferase (GAUT), galacturonosyltransferase-like (GATL), GATL-related (GATR), galactinol synthase (GolS), and plant glycogenin-like starch initiation proteins A (PGSIP-A), PGSIP-B, and PGSIP-C. We estimated that the GAUT subfamily might be further divided into four subgroups (I\&ndash;IV) due to differentiation of gene structures and expression patterns. Our orthogroup analysis identified 22 orthogroups with different sizes. Of these orthogroups, several orthogroups were lost in some species, such as S. italica and Z. mays. Moreover, lots of duplicate pairs and collinear pairs were discovered among these species. These results indicated that multiple duplication modes led to the expansion of this important gene family and unequal loss of orthogroups and subfamilies might have happened during the evolutionary process. RNA-seq, microarray analysis, and qRT-PCR analyses indicated that GT8 genes are critical for plant growth and development, and for stresses responses. We found that OsGolS1 was significantly up-regulated under salt stress, while OsGAUT21, OsGATL2, and OsGATL5 had remarkable up-regulation under cold stress. The current study highlighted the expansion and evolutionary patterns of the GT8 gene family in these seven Gramineae crop genomes and provided potential candidate genes for future salt- and cold- resistant molecular breeding studies in O. sativa.},

  abstract = {Heterosis has been widely used in agriculture, but the molecular mechanism for this remains largely elusive. In Arabidopsis hybrids and allopolyploids, increased photosynthetic and metabolic activities are linked to altered expression of circadian clock regulators, including CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1). It is unknown whether a similar mechanism mediates heterosis in maize hybrids. Here we report that higher levels of carbon fixation and starch accumulation in the maize hybrids are associated with altered temporal gene expression. Two maize CCA1 homologs, ZmCCA1a and ZmCCA1b, are diurnally up-regulated in the hybrids. Expressing ZmCCA1 complements the cca1 mutant phenotype in Arabidopsis, and overexpressing ZmCCA1b disrupts circadian rhythms and biomass heterosis. Furthermore, overexpressing ZmCCA1b in maize reduced chlorophyll content and plant height. Reduced height stems from reduced node elongation but not total node number in both greenhouse and field conditions. Phenotypes are less severe in the field than in the greenhouse, suggesting that enhanced light and/or metabolic activities in the field can compensate for altered circadian regulation in growth vigor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis reveals a temporal shift of ZmCCA1-binding targets to the early morning in the hybrids, suggesting that activation of morning-phased genes in the hybrids promotes photosynthesis and growth vigor. This temporal shift of ZmCCA1-binding targets correlated with nonadditive and additive gene expression in early and late stages of seedling development. These results could guide breeding better hybrid crops to meet the growing demand in food and bioenergy.},

  abstract = {Allene oxide synthase (AOS) catalyzes the entrance reaction in the biosynthesis of the octadecanoids 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) and jasmonic acid (JA). The enzyme is feedback-regulated by JA and thus a target of the JA-signalling pathway. A fusion genetic approach was used to isolate mutants in this signalling pathway. Seeds from transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the Escherichia coli uidA gene encoding {$\beta$}-glucuronidase (GUS) under the control of the AOS promoter were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate and the progeny was screened for individuals exhibiting constitutive expression of uidA in the absence of an added octadecanoid. From 21,000 mutagenized plants, 8 lines showing constitutive AOS expression were obtained. The mutant lines were characterized further and fell into four classes, I to IV. All showed signs of growth inhibition encompassing both shoot and root systems, and accumulated higher than normal levels of OPDA. Mutants belonging to classes I and IV failed to set seeds due to defects in flower development which prevented self-pollination. One mutant, designated cas1, was characterized in more detail and showed, in addition to elevated levels of AOS mRNA, AOS polypeptide, OPDA, and JA, constitutive expression of JA-responsive genes (VSP2, PDF1.2). The cas1 mutation is recessive and affects a single locus. Using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) and simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP), the mutated gene was mapped to chromosome IV next to the SSLP marker CIW7.},

  abstract = {Flavonoids represent a class of secondary metabolites with diverse functions in plants including ultraviolet protection, pathogen defense, and interspecies communication. They are also known as modulators of signaling processes in plant and animal systems and therefore are considered to have beneficial effects as nutraceuticals. The rol1-2 (for repressor of lrx1) mutation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) induces aberrant accumulation of flavonols and a cell-growth phenotype in the shoot. The hyponastic cotyledons, aberrant shape of pavement cells, and deformed trichomes in rol1-2 mutants are suppressed by blocking flavonoid biosynthesis, suggesting that the altered flavonol accumulation in these plants induces the shoot phenotype. Indeed, the identification of several transparent testa, myb, and fls1 (for flavonol synthase1) alleles in a rol1-2 suppressor screen provides genetic evidence that flavonols interfere with shoot development in rol1-2 seedlings. The increased accumulation of auxin in rol1-2 seedlings appears to be caused by a flavonol-induced modification of auxin transport. Quantification of auxin export from mesophyll protoplasts revealed that naphthalene-1-acetic acid but not indole-3-acetic acid transport is affected by the rol1-2 mutation. Inhibition of flavonol biosynthesis in rol1-2 fls1-3 restores naphthalene-1-acetic acid transport to wild-type levels, indicating a very specific mode of action of flavonols on the auxin transport machinery.},

Most of such methods are based on hard clustering of data wherein one gene (or sample) is assigned to exactly one cluster. Hard clustering, however, suffers from several drawbacks such as sensitivity to noise and information loss. In contrast, soft clustering methods can assign a gene to several clusters. They can overcome shortcomings of conventional hard clustering techniques and offer further advantages. Thus, we constructed an R package termed Mfuzz implementing soft clustering tools for microarray data analysis. The additional package Mfuzzgui provides a convenient TclTk based graphical user interface.

Transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) or its equivalent methods that combine random transposon mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) represent a powerful approach to understand gene functions in bacteria on a genome-wide scale. This approach has been utilized in a variety of bacterial species to provide comprehensive information on gene functions related to various phenotypes or biological processes of significance. With further improvements in the molecular protocol for specific amplification of transposon junction sequences and increasing capacity of next generation sequencing technologies, the applications of Tn-seq have been expanding to tackle questions that are important yet difficult to address in the past. In this review, we will discuss the technical aspects of different Tn-seq methods along with their pros and cons to provide a helpful guidance for those who want to implement or improve Tn-seq for their own research projects. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive summary of recent published studies based on Tn-seq methods to give an updated perspective on the current and emerging applications of Tn-seq.},

RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cotton is the dominant source of natural textile fibre and a significant oil crop. Cotton fibres, produced by certain species in the genus Gossypium, are seed trichomes derived from individual cells of the epidermal layer of the seed coat. Cotton fibre development is delineated into four distinct and overlapping developmental stages: fibre initiation, elongation, secondary wall biosynthesis and maturation. SCOPE: Recent advances in gene expression studies are beginning to provide new insights into a better understanding of early events in cotton fibre development. Fibre cell development is a complex process involving many pathways, including various signal transduction and transcriptional regulation components. Several analyses using expressed sequence tags and microarray have identified transcripts that preferentially accumulate during fibre development. These studies, as well as complementation and overexpression experiments using cotton genes in arabidopsis and tobacco, indicate some similar molecular events between trichome development from the leaf epidermis and fibre development from the ovule epidermis. Specifically, MYB transcription factors regulate leaf trichome development in arabidopsis and may regulate seed trichome development in cotton. In addition, transcript profiling and ovule culture experiments both indicate that several phytohormones and other signalling pathways mediate cotton fibre development. Auxin and gibberellins promote early stages of fibre initiation; ethylene- and brassinosteroid-related genes are up-regulated during the fibre elongation phase; and genes associated with calmodulin and calmodulin-binding proteins are up-regulated in fibre initials. Additional genomic data, mutant and functional analyses, and genome mapping studies promise to reveal the critical factors mediating cotton fibre cell development.},

Numerous studies have shown that plant pan-genomes are typically much larger than the genome of any individual and that a sizable fraction of the genes in any individual are present in only some genomes. The construction and interpretation of plant pan-genomes are challenging due to the large size and repetitive content of plant genomes. Most pan-genomes are largely focused on nontransposable element protein coding genes because they are more easily analyzed and defined than noncoding and repetitive sequences. Nevertheless, noncoding and repetitive DNA play important roles in determining the phenotype and genome evolution. Fortunately, it is now feasible to make multiple high-quality genomes that can be used to construct high-resolution pan-genomes that capture all the variation.

  abstract = {Auxin and ethylene are key regulators of plant growth and development, and thus the transcriptional networks that mediate responses to these hormones have been the subject of intense research. This study dissected the hormonal cross talk regulating the synthesis of flavonols and examined their impact on root growth and development. We analyzed the effects of auxin and an ethylene precursor on roots of wild-type and hormone-insensitive Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants at the transcript, protein, and metabolite levels at high spatial and temporal resolution. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) differentially increased flavonol pathway transcripts and flavonol accumulation, altering the relative abundance of quercetin and kaempferol. The IAA, but not ACC, response is lost in the transport inhibitor response1 (tir1) auxin receptor mutant, while ACC responses, but not IAA responses, are lost in ethylene insensitive2 (ein2) and ethylene resistant1 (etr1) ethylene signaling mutants. A kinetic analysis identified increases in transcripts encoding the transcriptional regulators MYB12, Transparent Testa Glabra1, and Production of Anthocyanin Pigment after hormone treatments, which preceded increases in transcripts encoding flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes. In addition, myb12 mutants were insensitive to the effects of auxin and ethylene on flavonol metabolism. The equivalent phenotypes for transparent testa4 (tt4), which makes no flavonols, and tt7, which makes kaempferol but not quercetin, showed that quercetin derivatives are the inhibitors of basipetal root auxin transport, gravitropism, and elongation growth. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that auxin and ethylene regulate flavonol biosynthesis through distinct signaling networks involving TIR1 and EIN2/ETR1, respectively, both of which converge on MYB12. This study also provides new evidence that quercetin is the flavonol that modulates basipetal auxin transport.},

  abstract = {The farmland of the world's main corn-producing area is increasingly affected by salt stress. Therefore, the breeding of salt-tolerant cultivars is necessary for the long-term sustainability of global corn production. Previous studies have shown that natural maize varieties display a large diversity of salt tolerance, yet the genetic variants underlying such diversity remain poorly discovered and applied, especially those mediating the tolerance to salt-induced osmotic stress (SIOS). Here we report a metabolomics-driven understanding and genetic improvement of maize SIOS tolerance. Using a LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach, we profiled the metabolomes of 266 maize inbred lines under control and salt conditions, and then identified 37 metabolite biomarkers of SIOS tolerance (METO1-37). Follow-up metabolic GWAS (mGWAS) and genotype-to-phenotype modeling identified 10 candidate genes significantly associating with the SIOS tolerance and METO abundances. Furthermore, we validated that a citrate synthase, a glucosyltransferase and a cytochrome P450 underlie the genotype-METO-SIOS tolerance associations, and showed that their favorable alleles additively improve the SIOS tolerance of elite maize inbred lines. Our study provides a novel insight into the natural variation of maize SIOS tolerance, which boosts the genetic improvement of maize salt tolerance, and demonstrates a metabolomics-based approach for mining crop genes associated with this complex agronomic trait.},

The genetic basis underlying plant architecture in rapeseed (Brassica napus), a key global oil crop, is elusive. We characterized an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized rapeseed mutant, sca, which had multiple phenotypic alterations, including crinkled leaves, semi-dwarf stature, narrow branch angles and upward-standing siliques. We identified the underlying gene, which encodes an Aux/IAA protein (BnaA3.IAA7). A G-to-A mutation changed the glycine at the 84th position to glutamic acid (G84E), disrupting the conserved degron motif GWPPV and reducing the affinity between BnaA3.IAA7 and TIR1 (TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1) in an auxin dosage-dependent manner. This change repressed the degradation of BnaA3.IAA7 and therefore repressed auxin signaling at low levels of auxin that reduced the length of internodes. The G84E mutation reduced branch angles by enhancing the gravitropic response. The heterozygote +/sca closely resembled a proposed ideal plant architecture, displaying strong yield heterosis through single-locus overdominance by improving multiple component traits. Our findings demonstrate that a weak gain-of-function mutation in BnaA3.IAA7 contributes to yield heterosis by improving plant architecture and would be valuable for breeding superior rapeseed hybrid cultivars and such a mutation may increase the yield in other Brassica crops.},

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identified 28 genetic loci associated with fibre quality in allotetraploid cotton. To investigate the regulatory roles of these loci, we sequenced fibre transcriptomes of 251 cotton accessions and identified 15 330 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Analysis of local eQTL and GWAS data prioritised 13 likely causal genes for differential fibre quality in a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). Characterisation of distal eQTL revealed unequal genetic regulation patterns between two subgenomes, highlighted by an eQTL hotspot (Hot216) that established a genome-wide genetic network regulating the expression of 962 genes. The primary regulatory role of Hot216, and specifically the gene encoding a KIP-related protein, was found to be the transcriptional regulation of genes responsible for cell wall synthesis, which contributes to fibre length by modulating the developmental transition from rapid cell elongation to secondary cell wall synthesis. This study uncovered the genetic regulation of fibre-cell development and revealed the molecular basis of the temporal modulation of secondary cell wall synthesis during plant cell elongation.},

However, little is known about their roles in case of pseudorabies virus (PrV) infection. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of host circRNAs from a virulent PrV type II strain DX (PrV-DX) infected and an~attenuated gE/TK deficient (gE-TK-PrV) strain of PrV infected PK-15 cells. CircRNAs were identified by find\_circ and analyzed with DESeq~2. Compared with the mock cells, 449 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs (233 down-regulated and 216 up-regulated) from PrV-DX infected and 578 DE circRNAs (331 down-regulated and 247 up-regulated) from gE-TK- PrV infected PK-15 cells were identified. In addition, 459 DE circRNAs (164 down-regulated and 295 up-regulated) between the PrV-DX and gE-TK-PrV infected cells were identified. The expression patterns of 13 circRNAs were validated by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and results were similar as of RNA-seq. The putative target miRNA binding sites of DE circRNAs were predicted by using miRanda and psRobot. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed and certain miRNAs that have possible roles in antiviral immune response, such as miR-210 and miR-340, were predicted. GO and KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that DE circRNAs were enriched in the processes such as cellular metabolism, protein binding, RNA degradation and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Collectively, these findings might provide the useful information for a better understanding of mechanisms underlying the interaction between PrV-II and host cells.},

  abstract = {The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data. Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental biological discoveries.},

In these circRNAs, exons are circularized with introns 'retained' between exons; we term them exon-intron circRNAs or EIciRNAs. EIciRNAs predominantly localize in the nucleus, interact with U1 snRNP and promote transcription of their parental genes. Our findings reveal a new role for circRNAs in regulating gene expression in the nucleus, in which EIciRNAs enhance the expression of their parental genes in cis, and highlight a regulatory strategy for transcriptional control via specific RNA-RNA interaction between U1 snRNA and EIciRNAs.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

  abstract = {Heterosis is a complex phenomenon in which hybrids show better phenotypic characteristics than their parents do. Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. spp. pekinensis) is a popular leafy crop species, hybrids of which are widely used in commercial production; however, the molecular basis of heterosis for biomass of Chinese cabbage is poorly understood. We characterized heterosis in a Chinese cabbage F1 hybrid cultivar and its parental lines from the seedling stage to the heading stage; marked heterosis of leaf weight and biomass yield were observed. Small RNA sequencing revealed 63 and 50 differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) at the seedling and early-heading stages, respectively. The expression levels of the majority of miRNA clusters in the F1 hybrid were lower than the mid-parent values (MPVs). Using degradome sequencing, we identified 1,819 miRNA target genes. Gene ontology (GO) analyses demonstrated that the target genes of the MPV-DEMs and low parental expression level dominance (ELD) miRNAs were significantly enriched in leaf morphogenesis, leaf development, and leaf shaping. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression levels of photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis-related MPV-DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were significantly different in the F1 hybrid compared to the parental lines, resulting in increased photosynthesis capacity and chlorophyll content in the former. Furthermore, expression of genes known to regulate leaf development was also observed at the seedling stage. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing BrGRF4.2 and bra-miR396 presented increased and decreased leaf sizes, respectively. These results provide new insight into the regulation of target genes and miRNA expression patterns in leaf size and heterosis for biomass of B. rapa.},

In this study, we integrated high-resolution spatio-temporal metabolome and transcriptome data to systematically explore the metabolic landscape across 20 major tomato tissues and growth stages. In the resulting MicroTom Metabolic Network, the 540 detected metabolites and their co-expressed genes could be divided into 10 distinct clusters based on their biological functions. Using this dataset, we constructed a global map of the major metabolic changes that occur throughout the tomato growth cycle and dissected the underlying regulatory network. In addition to verifying previously well-established regulatory networks for important metabolites, we identified novel transcription factors that regulate the biosynthesis of important secondary metabolites~such as steroidal glycoalkaloids and flavonoids. Our findings provide insights into spatio-temporal changes in tomato metabolism and generate a valuable resource for the study of metabolic regulatory processes in model plants.},

To better understand the molecular basis for this success, we performed mRNA and small RNA transcriptome analyses in nascent allohexaploid wheat and its following generations, their progenitors, and the natural allohexaploid cultivar Chinese Spring, with the assistance of recently published A and D genome sequences. We found that nonadditively expressed protein-coding genes were rare but relevant to growth vigor. Moreover, a high proportion of protein-coding genes exhibited parental expression level dominance, with genes for which the total homoeolog expression level in the progeny was similar to that in T. turgidum potentially participating in development and those with similar expression to that in Ae. tauschii involved in adaptation. In addition, a high proportion of microRNAs showed nonadditive expression upon polyploidization, potentially leading to differential expression of important target genes. Furthermore, increased small interfering RNA density was observed for transposable element\textendash associated D homoeologs in the allohexaploid progeny, which may account for biased repression of D homoeologs. Together, our data provide insights into small RNA\textendash mediated dynamic homoeolog regulation mechanisms that may contribute to heterosis in nascent hexaploid wheat. 初生的异源六倍体小麦可能代表了普通小麦的初始遗传状态，普通小麦是由圆锥小麦和节节麦杂交而成，通过染色体加倍，在生长势和适应性方面超过了亲本。为了更好地了解这一成功的分子基础，我们在最近发表的 a 和 d 基因组序列的帮助下，对新生异六倍体小麦及其后代、其前体和中国春小麦品种进行了 mRNA 和小 RNA 转录组分析。我们发现非加性表达的蛋白质编码基因很少，但与生长势有关。此外，蛋白质编码基因表现出亲本表达水平显性的比例较高，其后代的总同源表达水平与可能参与发育的旋毛虫相似，表达水平与亚科旋毛虫相似。Tauschii 参与了适应。此外，microrna 在多倍化过程中表现出高比例的非加性表达，可能导致重要靶基因的差异表达。此外，在同源六倍体子代中，观察到与小干扰RNA 有关的 d 同源异转座子密度增加，这可能解释 d 同源异型异源异型异型异型异型异型异型异型异型异型异型异型异型异源异型异型异型异型异型异型异型异。总之，我们的数据提供了小 RNA 介导的动态同源异型调控机制，可能有助于新生六倍体小麦的杂种优势。},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apple is an economically important fruit crop. Changes in metabolism accompanying human-guided evolution can be revealed using a multiomics approach. We perform genome-wide metabolic analysis of apple fruits collected from 292 wild and cultivated accessions representing various consumption types. RESULTS: We find decreased amounts of certain metabolites, including tannins, organic acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids as the wild accessions transition to cultivated apples, while lysolipids increase in the "Golden Delicious" to "Ralls Janet" pedigree, suggesting better storage. We identify a total of 222,877 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with 2205 apple metabolites. Investigation of a region from 2.84 to 5.01~Mb on chromosome 16 containing co-mapping regions for tannins, organic acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids indicates the importance of these metabolites for fruit quality and nutrition during breeding. The tannin and acidity-related genes Myb9-like and PH4 are mapped closely to fruit weight locus fw1 from 3.41 to 3.76~Mb on chromosome 15, a region under selection during domestication. Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) 18:1, which is suppressed by fatty acid desaturase-2 (FAD2), is positively correlated to fruit firmness. We find the fruit weight is negatively correlated with salicylic acid and abscisic acid levels. Further functional assays demonstrate regulation of these hormone levels by NAC-like activated by Apetala3/Pistillata (NAP) and ATP binding cassette G25 (ABCG25), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a metabolic perspective for selection on fruit quality during domestication and improvement, which is a valuable resource for investigating mechanisms controlling apple metabolite content and quality.},

In this paper, a novel approach was established to transform a non-targeted metabolic profiling method to a pseudo-targeted method using the retention time locking gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring (RTL-GC/MS-SIM). To achieve this transformation, an algorithm based on the automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS), GC/MS raw data and a bi-Gaussian chromatographic peak model was developed. The established GC/MS-SIM method was compared with GC/MS-full scan (the total ion current and extracted ion current, TIC and EIC) methods, it was found that for a typical tobacco leaf extract, 93\% components had their relative standard deviations (RSDs) of relative peak areas less than 20\% by the SIM method, while 88\% by the EIC method and 81\% by the TIC method. 47.3\% components had their linear correlation coefficient higher than 0.99, compared with 5.0\% by the EIC and 6.2\% by TIC methods. Multivariate analysis showed the pooled quality control samples clustered more tightly using the developed method than using GC/MS-full scan methods, indicating a better data quality. With the analysis of the variance of the tobacco samples from three different planting regions, 167 differential components (p{$<$}0.05) were screened out using the RTL-GC/MS-SIM method, but 151 and 131 by the EIC and TIC methods, respectively. The results show that the developed method not only has a higher sensitivity, better linearity and data quality, but also does not need complicated peak alignment among different samples. It is especially suitable for the screening of differential components in the metabolic profiling investigation.},

Although the molecular basis for heterosis has been extensively studied, metabolic and proteomic contributions to heterosis remain elusive. Here we report an integrative analysis of time-series metabolome and proteome data in maize (Zea mays) hybrids and their inbred parents. Many maize metabolites and proteins are diurnally regulated, and many of these show nonadditive abundance in the hybrids, including key enzymes and metabolites involved in carbon assimilation. Compared with robust trait heterosis, metabolic heterosis is relatively mild. Interestingly, most amino acids display negative mid-parent heterosis (MPH), i.e., having lower values than the average of the parents, while sugars, alcohols, and nucleoside metabolites show positive MPH. From the network perspective, metabolites in the photosynthetic pathway show positive MPH, whereas metabolites in the photorespiratory pathway show negative MPH, which corresponds to nonadditive protein abundance and enzyme activities of key enzymes in the respective pathways in the hybrids. Moreover, diurnally expressed proteins that are upregulated in the hybrids are enriched in photosynthesis-related gene-ontology terms. Hybrids may more effectively remove toxic metabolites generated during photorespiration, and thus maintain higher photosynthetic efficiency. These metabolic and proteomic resources provide unique insight into heterosis and its utilization for high yielding maize and other crop plants.},

The advent of new high-throughput sequencing technologies coupled with bioinformatics tools revealed the presence of these molecules in the transcriptome of a wide range of organisms. In animals, circRNAs can modulate gene expression and act as sponges of miRNAs~to inhibit their activity. It has been demonstrated that they have the potential to be diagnostic biomarkers as their expression is closely associated to human diseases, such as Alzheimer and cancer. However, in plants their function remains elusive. Recently, the role of the circRNAs in plant stress responses has been studied. During the infection of Pseudomonas syringae in kiwifruit plants, 584 circRNAs were differentially expressed in leaf samples, and a group of them could be further associated with the stage of infection. Under phosphate deficiency conditions, 27 rice circRNAs were reported to be differentially expressed. In tomato, 163 circRNAs demonstrated chilling-responsive expression, with 102 containing miRNA-binding sites~and are predicted to act as miRNA sponges. Additionally,~Arabidopsis seedlings~presented 1583 heat-specific circRNAs, and it was also~reported that heat stress could increase the quantity, length, and alternative circularization events of circRNAs. Finally, wheat seedlings~under dehydration stress had 62 circRNAs differentially expressed, with 6 being predicted as miRNA sponges. Although the role of plant circRNAs during the biotic and abiotic stresses is still poorly characterised, these molecules have the potential to expand the number of targets and tools in the biotechnology~field.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Curds are the main edible organs, which exhibit remarkable yield heterosis in F1 hybrid broccoli. However, the molecular basis underlying heterosis in broccoli remains elusive. RESULTS: In the present study, transcriptome profiles revealed that the hybridization made most genes show additive expression patterns in hybrid broccoli. The differentially expressed genes including the non-additively expressed genes detected in the hybrid broccoli and its parents were mainly involved in light, hormone and hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling pathways, responses to stresses, and regulation of floral development, which suggested that these biological processes should play crucial roles in the yield heterosis of broccoli. Among them, light and hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling pathways represent two novel classes of regulatory processes that could function in yield or biomass heterosis of plants. Totally, 53 candidate genes closely involved in curd yield heterosis were identified. Methylome data indicated that the DNA methylation ratio of the hybrids was higher than that of their parents. However, the DNA methylation levels of most sites also displayed additive expression patterns. These sites with differential methylation levels were predominant in the intergenic regions. In most cases, the changes of DNA methylation levels in gene regions did not significantly affect their expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: The differentially expressed genes, the regulatory processes and the possible roles of DNA methylation modification in the formation of curd yield heterotic trait were discovered. These findings provided comprehensive insights into the curd yield heterosis in broccoli, and were significant for breeding high-yield broccoli varieties.},

Here, we report that the Ca2+-permeable transporter ANNEXIN1 (AtANN1) mediates cold-triggered Ca2+ influx and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. The loss of function of AtANN1 substantially impaired freezing tolerance, reducing the cold-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase and upregulation of the cold-responsive CBF and COR genes. Further analysis showed that the OST1/SnRK2.6 kinase interacted with and phosphorylated AtANN1, which consequently enhanced its Ca2+ transport activity, thereby potentiating Ca2+ signaling. Consistent with these results and freezing sensitivity of ost1 mutants, the cold-induced [Ca2+]cyt elevation in the ost1-3 mutant was reduced. Genetic analysis indicated that AtANN1 acts downstream of OST1 in responses to cold stress. Our data thus uncover a cascade linking OST1-AtANN1 to cold-induced Ca2+ signal generation, which activates the cold response and consequently enhances freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis.},

  abstract = {Because reproductive growth could be influenced by sucrose metabolism of major source leaf (leaf subtending to cotton boll, LSCB), we hypothesized that decreased temperatures under field conditions would limit morphology and biomass distributions of the whole cotton plant by decreasing photosynthesis of LSCB and inhibiting sucrose metabolism in LSCB. To address this hypothesis, two cotton cultivars, Kemian 1 and Sumian 15, were grown at three planting dates (25 April, 25 May and 10 June) in 2009\textendash 2011 to obtain LSCB and bolls exposed to contrasting ambient temperatures while at the same developmental stage (white flowers on the first position of 6\textendash 7th fruiting branches). Sample collection and measurement were conducted during boll development at MDTmin of 25.9\textdegree C and 24.0\textdegree C for the early planting date of 25 April (optimal planting date in the Yangtze River Valley), 20.4\textdegree C and 18.4\textdegree C for the 25 May planting date, and 16.5\textdegree C and 16.0\textdegree C for the 10 June planting date in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Microclimate measurements included photosynthetic active radiation, relative humidity and air temperature. Late planting decreased boll number, boll weight, LAI, total biomass and harvest index (P{$<$}0.05), but increased leaf to shoot, leaf to stem and leaf to boll ratios. Cool temperature increased SLW and carbohydrate contents in LSCB, but decreased Pn and sucrose transformation rate in LSCB (P{$<$}0.05). Under cool temperatures (MDTmin of 20.4\textdegree C and 16.5\textdegree C in 2010, and 18.4\textdegree C and 16.0\textdegree C in 2011 during boll development) in the late planting dates (25 May and/or 10 June), the activities of Rubisco and cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cy-FBPase) increased, whereas sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose synthase (SuSy) activities decreased, and their peak values were delayed. The variability of Pn, SPS activity, sucrose transformation rate in LSCB and boll weight under cool temperature for Sumian 15 was greater than those of Kemian 1. In addition, there was a significantly positive correlation between Pn and SPS in LSCB, as well as SPS and boll weight in 2010 and 2011 (P{$<$}0.05). It is concluded that, of the measured physiological and reproductive processes, the difference of sucrose metabolizing enzymes in LSCB for the two cotton cultivars under cool temperature due to late planting were mainly determined by SPS activity, while higher Pn and SPS in LSCB were necessary to improve boll weight. However, greater boll weight does not necessarily need high Pn, SPS and SuSy activities, and great sucrose transformation rate in LSCB.},

In this study, we collected 548 sets of data of DM, HI, and grain yield from a multisite (40 sites) and multiyear (2009\textendash 2016) experiment conducted in major maize-growing regions across China and 615 sets of data from 40 published papers distributed from 1988 to 2018 to assess the performance of DM, HI, and their contributions to grain yield. It was found that the average contribution rate of DM was 73.71\%, which was much higher than those of HI (26.28\%) across China. For the five different modern hybrids, the contribution rates of DM to grain yield (ranged from 71.36\% to 89.10\%) were also significantly higher than those of HI (ranged from 10.79\% to 28.64\%) on a large spatial scale. The significant differences in grain yields between cultivars were mainly due to the differences in HI. Among the four maize-growing regions, the contribution rates of DM in both NW (57.34\%) and NM (64.46\%) were higher than those of HI (42.66\% and 35.54\%, respectively). In contrast, the contribution rates of HI in HM (52.67\%) and SW (50.92\%) were slightly higher than those of DM (47.33\% and 49.08\%, respectively). The interregional differences in grain yield were mainly attributed to the differences in DM between regions. Additionally, combining the data of this study and data collected from previous studies, we found that the increase in maize grain yield under lower yield levels ({$<$}15 Mg/ha) was mainly attributed to the increase in both DM and HI, while that under higher yield levels ({$>$}15 Mg/ha) was mainly dependent on the increase in DM.},

TcCGT1 was relatively stable over the pH range of 7.0\textendash 10.0 at a temperature lower than 45 \textdegree C. The coupled catalytic strategy of TcCGT1 and different sucrose synthases was adopted to enhance the production of orientin and vitexin. By optimizing the coupling reaction conditions, orientin and vitexin production successfully achieved 2324.4 and 5524.1 mg/L with a yield of 91.4 and 89.3\% (mol/mol), respectively.

Owing to heterosis (hybrid vigor) in plants, these hybrids often have superior agricultural performances in yield or disease resistance succeeding their inbred parental lines. Several classical hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genetic causes of heterosis. During recent years, many new genetics and genomics strategies have been developed and used for the identifications of heterotic genes in plants. Heterotic effects of the heterotic loci and molecular functions of the heterotic genes are being investigated in many plants such as rice, maize, sorghum, Arabidopsis and tomato. More and more data and knowledge coming from the molecular studies of heterotic loci and genes will serve as a valuable resource for hybrid breeding by molecular design in future. This review aims to address recent advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of heterosis in plants. The remaining scientific questions on the molecular basis of heterosis and the potential applications in breeding are also proposed and discussed.},

A better understanding of fiber pigment regulation is needed to surmount these obstacles. In this work, transcriptome analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR revealed that 13 and 9 phenylpropanoid (metabolic) pathway genes were enriched during pigment synthesis, while the differential expression of phenylpropanoid (metabolic) and flavonoid metabolic pathway genes occurred among BCF, GCF, and white cotton fibers (WCF). Silencing the chalcone flavanone isomerase gene in a BCF line resulted in three fiber phenotypes among offspring of the RNAi lines: BCF, almost WCF, and GCF. The lines with almost WCF suppressed chalcone flavanone isomerase, while the lines with GCF highly expressed the glucosyl transferase (3GT) gene. Overexpression of the Gh3GT or Arabidopsis thaliana 3GT gene in BCF lines resulted in GCF. Additionally, the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolites of BCF and GCF were significantly higher than those of WCF as assessed by a metabolomics analysis. Thus, the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway controls both brown and green pigmentation processes. Like natural colored fibers, the transgenic colored fibers were weaker and shorter than WCF. This study shows the potential of flavonoid pathway modifications to alter cotton fibers' color and quality.},

In tetraploid Gossypium species, LTR retrotransposon families from the progenitor D genome had more copies in D-subgenome, and families from the progenitor A genome had more copies in A-subgenome. Some LTR retrotransposon families that insert after polyploid formation may still distribute the majority of its copies in one of the subgenomes. The data also shows that families of 10\textasciitilde 200 copies are abundant and they have a great influence on the Gossypium genome size; on the contrary, a small number of high copy LTR retrotransposon families have less contribution to the genome size. Kimura distance distribution indicates that high copy number family is not a recent outbreak, and there is no obvious relationship between family copy number and the period of evolution. Further analysis reveals that each LTR retrotransposon family may have their own distribution characteristics in cotton.},

In total, we found 200, 3576 and 4056 genes exhibiting significant AS pattern changes in response to DS, HS and HD, respectively, and combined drought and heat stress can induce specific AS compared with individual one. In addition, wheat homeologous genes exhibited differential AS responses under stress conditions that more AS events occurred on B subgenome than on A and D genomes. Comparison of genes regulated at AS and transcriptional levels showed that only 12\% of DS-induced AS genes were subjected to transcriptional regulation, whereas the proportion increased to 40\% under HS and HD. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that abiotic stress-responsive pathways tended to be highly overrepresented among these overlapped genes under HS and HD. Thus, we proposed that transcriptional regulation may play a major role in response to DS, which coordinates with AS regulation to contribute to HS and HD tolerance in wheat.},

Here, we find that a 28-day IF regimen for diabetic mice improves behavioral impairment via a microbiota-metabolites-brain axis: IF enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism gene expression in hippocampus, re-structures the gut microbiota, and improves microbial metabolites that are related to cognitive function. Moreover, strong connections are observed between IF affected genes, microbiota and metabolites, as assessed by integrative modelling. Removing gut microbiota with antibiotics partly abolishes the neuroprotective effects of IF. Administration of 3-indolepropionic acid, serotonin, short chain fatty acids or tauroursodeoxycholic acid shows a similar effect to IF in terms of improving cognitive function. Together, our study purports the microbiota-metabolites-brain axis as a mechanism that can enable therapeutic strategies against metabolism-implicated cognitive pathophysiologies.},

Circular RNAs have recently been reported as the microRNA sponge to accomplish corresponding regulatory roles. This study aims to explore the expression profile and functional role of circRNAs in Arabidopsis leaf growth and senescence. We used publically available RNA-seq data of Arabidopsis leaves to identify the circular RNA expression profile and used quantitative real-time PCR to validate our identified circular RNAs. The functions of circRNAs were explored using distinct bioinformatics methods including analysis of network, gene ontology and KEGG pathway. We identified 168 circRNAs, including 40 novel circRNAs, in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, with 158 (94.1\%) circRNAs arising from the exons of genes. Real-time PCRs were used to verify 4 highly expressed circRNAs and they all showed consistent expression patterns with the RNA-seq results. Interestingly, 6 and 35 circRNAs were differentially expressed at G-to-M stage and M-to-S stage, respectively. The circRNAs display an upregulation trend during the lifespan of Arabidopsis leaves. Moreover, the expression of circRNAs during senescence is independent of host gene expression to a certain degree. The gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis of the targeted mRNA of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network showed that the circRNAs may be involved in plant hormone signal transduction, Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism during leaves senencence. Our comprehensive analysis of the expression profile of circular RNAs and their potential functions during leaf growth and senescence suggest that circRNAs may function as new post-transcriptional regulators in the senescence of Arabidopsis leaves.},

Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with different chromatographic methods, is suitable for large-scale metabolomics study due to its high sensitivity and selectivity, wide dynamic range, and rich information. However, there are still a series of challenges for really realizing large-scale metabolomics applications. Hence, in this review, we mainly focused on new advances in sample pretreatment methods, nontargeted, targeted and pseudotargeted metabolic data collection techniques, and data correction methods used for MS-based large-scale metabolomics study. Typical applications of MS-based large-scale metabolomics methods in molecular epidemiology, precision medicine, and genome-wide association studies with metabolomics (mGWAS) are also given.},

Previous studies have shown that NUDXs are extensively involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses in different plant species; however, the role of NUDXs in plant growth and development remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified and characterized OsNUDX14 localized in the mitochondria in rice. Results showed that OsNUDX14 is constitutively expressed in various tissues and most strongly expressed in mature leaves. We used CRISPR/Cas9 introducing mutations that editing OsNUDX14 and its encoding product. OsNUDX14-Cas9 (nudx14) lines presented early flowering and a larger flag leaf angle during the reproductive stage. In addition, OsNUDX14 affected grain chalkiness in rice. Furthermore, transcript profile analysis indicated that OsNUDX14 is associated with lignin biosynthesis in rice. Six major haplotypes were identified by six OsNUDX14 missense mutations, including Hap\_1 to Hap\_6. Accessions having the Hap\_5 allele were geographically located mainly in South and Southeast Asia with a low frequency in the Xian/indica subspecies. This study revealed that OsNUDX14 is associated with plant development and grain chalkiness, providing a potential opportunity to optimize plant architecture and quality for crop breeding.},

Using these assembled genomes together with three previously reported genomes, we constructed a graph-based genome and performed pan-genome analysis, which identified numerous genetic variations that cannot be detected by direct mapping of short sequence reads onto a single reference genome. The structural variations from the 2,898 accessions that were genotyped based on the graph-based genome and the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the representative 26 accessions helped to link genetic variations to candidate genes that are responsible for important traits. This pan-genome resource will promote evolutionary and functional genomics studies in soybean.},

Polyploid organisms are widespread in plants, indicating that polyploidy has some evolutionary advantages over its diploid ancestor. Actually, polyploidy is always tightly associated with hybrid vigor and adaptation to adverse environmental conditions. However, why polyploidy can develop such advantages is poorly known. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous {$\sim$}21\,nt small RNAs which can play important regulatory roles in animals and plants by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. MicroRNAs are essential for cell development, differentiation, signal transduction, and show an adaptive response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Environmental stresses cause plants to over- or under-express certain miRNAs or synthesize new miRNAs to cope with stress. We have here reviewed our current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms, which can account for the evolutionary advantages of polyploidy over its diploid ancestor from genome-wide gene expression and microRNAs expression perspectives.},

However, only a few biologically active substances have been identified from S. collina. Here, the shoots and roots of S. collina, namely L-Sc and R-Sc, were studied. The primary and secondary metabolites were investigated using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). A total of 637 putative metabolites were identified and these metabolites were mainly classified into ten different categories. Correlation analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis of metabolites showed that the L-Sc samples could be clearly separated from the R-Sc samples. Differential accumulated metabolite analysis revealed that most of differential primary metabolites were significantly lower in the L-Sc than in the R-Sc. Conversely, the major differential secondary metabolites had higher levels in the L-Sc than in the R-Sc. Further analysis indicated that the flavonoids were the major putative antioxidant components and most of putative antioxidant components exhibited higher relative concentrations in the L-Sc than the R-Sc. These results improve our understanding of metabolite accumulation and provide a reference for the study of medicinal value in S. collina.},

  abstract = {Exogenous mechanical perturbations on living tissues are commonly used to investigate whether cell effectors can respond to mechanical cues. However, in most of these experiments, the applied mechanical stress and/or the biological response are described only qualitatively. We developed a quantitative pipeline based on microindentation and image analysis to investigate the impact of a controlled and prolonged compression on microtubule behaviour in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem, using microtubule fluorescent marker lines. We found that a compressive stress, in the order of magnitude of turgor pressure, induced apparent microtubule bundling. Importantly, that response could be reversed several hours after the release of compression. Next, we tested the contribution of microtubule severing to compression-induced bundling: microtubule bundling seemed less pronounced in the katanin mutant, in which microtubule severing is dramatically reduced. Conversely, some microtubule bundles could still be observed 16 h after the release of compression in the spiral2 mutant, in which severing rate is instead increased. To quantify the impact of mechanical stress on anisotropy and orientation of microtubule arrays, we used the nematic tensor based FibrilTool ImageJ/Fiji plugin. To assess the degree of apparent bundling of the network, we developed several methods, some of which were borrowed from geostatistics. The final microtubule bundling response could notably be related to tissue growth velocity that was recorded by the indenter during compression. Because both input and output are quantified, this pipeline is an initial step towards correlating more precisely the cytoskeleton response to mechanical stress in living tissues.},

History has numerous examples of both. The diversity of many crops have gone through domestication, dispersal and modernization bottlenecks. Between these major decreasing processes, diversity has picked up through different evolutionary processes, and plant breeding affected by policies. Major negative effects of plant breeding on diversity have been recorded following the modernization bottleneck, but alternative breeding strategies have come up as well, both in the formal system and in the interphase between formal and farmers' seed systems. Multiline breeding and participatory plant breeding are introduced as examples to also analyse effects of current developments in technology and policy. This paper intends to shed some light on the questions: how will current developments in technology and policy affect crop genetic diversity? Are we heading for a new bottleneck\textemdash either a molecular or a policy bottleneck, or a combination of both? Or could the future become more diverse? We look at the relationship between breeding, policies, and crop genetic diversity in farming systems with a birds-eye view. Notably because of current policy trends we warn for a new diversity bottleneck.},

  abstract = {In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, structural variation is abundant in many plant genomes. The structural variation across a species can be represented by a `pan-genome', which is essential to fully understand the genetic control of phenotypes. However, the pan-genome's complexity hinders its accurate assembly via sequence alignment. Here we demonstrate an approach to facilitate pan-genome construction in maize. By performing 18 trillion association tests we map 26 million tags generated by reduced representation sequencing of 14,129 maize inbred lines. Using machine-learning models we select 4.4 million accurately mapped tags as sequence anchors, 1.1 million of which are presence/absence variations. Structural variations exhibit enriched association with phenotypic traits, indicating that it is a significant source of adaptive variation in maize. The ability to efficiently map ultrahigh-density pan-genome sequence anchors enables fine characterization of structural variation and will advance both genetic research and breeding in many crops.},

  abstract = {Flavonoids are widely distributed secondary metabolites as well as a major class of chemical defenses in response to light intensity, temperature, and other external factors. However, systematic investigation on the genetic basis of flavonoids in perennial trees is poorly documented. In this study, we married metabolite-based genome wide association analysis (mGWAS), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping and weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis to systematically construct the regulatory network underlying flavonoids decoration in Populus. We firstly characterized 172 flavonoids features in 300 natural accessions of Populus tomentosa collected in three widespread geographical regions. Then, we conducted systematical genetic strategy to identify casual candidate genes, and constructed the regulatory network of flavonoids biosynthesis of Populus. Selection signature revealed 83 metabolites exhibited significant divergence among three geographical regions of Populus, we thus determined candidate genes contributing to flavonoids divergence based on the selection sweep analysis. Furthermore, we focused on PtoLDOX, a key gene responsible for the levels of anthocyanin and dihydrokaempferol, and dissected it through allelic frequency and haplotype analysis. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the genetic basis of flavonoids biosynthesis, and sheds light on the adaptive selection to different geographical regions that potentially dominated by the flavonoids of Populus, facilitating marker-based breeding in poplar varieties.},

  abstract = {Hybrid vigor, also known as heterosis, has been widely utilized in agronomic production of maize (Zea mays L.) and other crops. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis are still not fully understood. To provide a more complete understanding of the transcriptomic dynamics associated with heterosis, we collected a comprehensive set of sequence data on linear mRNA transcripts and circular RNAs (circRNAs) from seedling leaves of two widely used maize inbred lines and their F1 hybrid at the V4 growth stage. We detected over 25,000 expressed genes with more than 1200 circRNAs that showed dramatic and distinct variations in expression level across the three genotypes. Although most linear and circular transcripts exhibited additive expression in the hybrid, the expression of circRNAs was more likely to be nonadditive. Interestingly, the levels of linear transcripts and their corresponding circRNAs from the same loci showed a significant relationship and coordinated expression mode across all three genotypes. Notably, in the hybrid, allele-specific expression of linear transcripts was significantly associated with the expression of circRNAs from the same locus, suggesting potential regulatory cross talk between linear and circular transcripts. Our study provides a deeper understanding of dynamic variations for both the linear and circular transcriptome in a classical hybrid triplet of maize.},

However, repeatability is still an essential issue for the LC\textendash MS based methods, and convincing strategies for long time analysis are urgently required. Our former reported pseudotargeted method which combines nontargeted and targeted analyses, is proved to be a practical approach with high-quality and information-rich data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive strategy based on the pseudotargeted analysis by integrating blank-wash, pooled quality control (QC) sample, and post-calibration for the large-scale metabolomics study. The performance of strategy was optimized from both pre- and post-acquisition sections including the selection of QC samples, insertion frequency of QC samples, and post-calibration methods. These results imply that the pseudotargeted method is rather stable and suitable for large-scale study of metabolic profiling. As a proof of concept, the proposed strategy was applied to the combination of 3 independent batches within a time span of 5 weeks, and generated about 54\% of the features with coefficient of variations (CV) below 15\%. Moreover, the stability and maximal capability of a single analytical batch could be extended to at least 282 injections (about 110h) while still providing excellent stability, the CV of 63\% metabolic features was less than 15\%. Taken together, the improved repeatability of our strategy provides a reliable protocol for large-scale metabolomics studies.},

  abstract = {Heterosis has been extensively utilized to increase productivity in crops, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we generated transcriptome-wide profiles of mRNA abundance, m6A methylation, and translational efficiency from the maize F1 hybrid B73\texttimes Mo17 and its two parental lines to ascertain the contribution of each regulatory layer to heterosis at the seedling stage. We documented that although the global abundance and distribution of m6A remained unchanged, a greater number of genes had gained an m6A modification in the hybrid. Superior variations were observed at the m6A modification and translational efficiency levels when compared with mRNA abundance between the hybrid and parents. In the hybrid, the vast majority of genes with m6A modification exhibited a non-additive expression pattern, the percentage of which was much higher than that at levels of mRNA abundance and translational efficiency. Non-additive genes involved in different biological processes were hierarchically coordinated by discrete combinations of three regulatory layers. These findings suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression make distinct contributions to heterosis in hybrid maize. Overall, this integrated multi-omics analysis provides a valuable portfolio for interpreting transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in hybrid maize, and paves the way for exploring molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid vigor.},

  abstract = {Abiotic stresses have negative effects on plants growth and development. Plants, being sessile, have developed specific adaptive strategies that allow them to rapidly detect and respond to abiotic stress factors. The detoxification efflux carriers (DTX)/multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporters are of significance in the translocation of abscisic acid (ABA), a phytohormone with profound role in plants under various abiotic stress conditions. The ABA signaling cascades are the core regulators of abiotic stress responses in plants, triggering major changes in gene expression and adaptive physiological responses. We therefore carried out genome-wide analysis of the DTX/MATE gene family, transformed a DTX/MATE gene in Arabidopsis and carried out functional analysis under drought, salt, and cold stress conditions. We identified 128, 70, and 72 DTX/MATE genes in Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium arboreum, and Gossypium raimondii, respectively. The proteins encoded by the DTX/MATE genes showed varied physiochemical properties but they all were hydrophobic. The Gh\_D06G0281 (DTX/MATE) over-expressing Arabidopsis lines were highly tolerant under drought, salt, and cold stress with high production of antioxidant enzymes and significantly reduced levels of oxidants. Lipid peroxidation, as measured by the level of malondialdehyde concentrations was relatively low in transgenic lines compared to wild types, an indication of reduced oxidative stress levels in the transgenic plants. Based on physiological measurements, the transgenic plants exhibited significantly higher relative leaf water content, reduced excised leaf water loss and a significant reduction in ion leakage as a measure of the cell membrane stability compared to the wild types. Abiotic stress responsive genes, ABF4, CBL1, SOS1, and RD29B were highly expressed in the transgenic lines compared to the non-transformed wild type plants. The protein encoded by the Gh\_D06G0281 (DTX/MATE) gene was predicted to be located within the plasma membrane. Since signals from extracellular stimuli are transmitted through the plasma membrane most of which are conducted by plasma membrane proteins it is possible the Gh\_D06G0281 (DTX/MATE) gene product could be important for this process.},

Here, the regulatory role of a novel protein GhCFE1A was uncovered. GhCFE1A is preferentially expressed at initiation and rapid elongation stages during fibre development; in addition, much higher expression of GhCFE1A was detected at the fibre initiation stage in fibreless cotton mutants than in the fibre-bearing TM-1 wild-type. Importantly, overexpression of GhCFE1A in cotton not only delayed fibre cell elongation but also significantly reduced the density of lint and fuzz fibre initials and stem trichomes. Yeast two-hybrid assay showed that GhCFE1A interacted with several actin proteins, and the interaction was further confirmed by co-sedimentation assay. Interestingly, a subcellular localization assay showed that GhCFE1A resided on the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network and co-localized with actin cables. Moreover, the density of F-actin filaments was shown to be reduced in GhCFE1A-overexpressing fibres at the rapid elongation stage compared with the wild-type control. Taken together, the results demonstrate that GhCFE1A probably functions as a dynamic linker between the actin cytoskeleton and the ER network, and plays an important role in fibre cell initiation and elongation during cotton fibre development.},

In order to explore the genetic basis of heterosis in Upland cotton, we generated paternal and maternal backcross (BC/P and BC/M) populations. Data for yield and yield-component traits were collected over 2 years in three replicated BC/P field trials and four replicated BC/M field trials. At single-locus level, 26 and 27 QTLs were identified in BC/P and BC/M populations, respectively. Six QTLs shared in both BC populations. A total of 27 heterotic loci were detected. Partial dominant and over-dominant QTLs mainly determined yield heterosis in the BC/P and BC/M populations. QTLs for different traits displayed varied genetic effects in two BC populations. Eleven heterotic loci overlapped with QTLs but no common heterotic locus was detected in both BC populations. We resolved the 333\,kb (48 genes) and 516\,kb (25 genes) physical intervals based on 16 QTL clusters and 35 common QTLs, respectively, in more than one environment or population. We also identified 189 epistatic QTLs and a number of QTL\,\texttimes\,environment interactions in two BC populations and the corresponding MPH datasets. The results indicated that cumulative effects contributed to yield heterosis in Upland cotton, including epistasis, QTL\,\texttimes\,environment interaction, additive, partial dominance and over-dominance.},

As planting densities increase, the GY per plot also increases, whereas the contribution of heterosis to GY decreases. There are trade-offs between heterosis and planting density, and the transcriptional characterization of heterosis may explain the mechanism involved. In this study, 48 transcriptome libraries were sequenced from four inbred Chinese maize lines and their F1 hybrids. They were planted at densities of 45000 and 67500 plants ha-1. Maternal-effect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) played important roles in processes related to photosynthesis and carbohydrate biosynthesis and metabolism. Paternal-effect DEGs participated in abiotic/biotic stress response and plant hormone production under high planting density. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed that high planting density induced heterosis-related genes regulating abiotic/biotic stress response, plant hormone biosynthesis, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, but repressed other genes regulating energy formation. Under high planting density, maternal genes were mainly enriched in the photosynthesis reaction center, while paternal genes were mostly concentrated in the peripheral antenna system. Four important genes were identified in maize heterosis and high planting density, all with functions in photosynthesis, starch biosynthesis, auxin metabolism, gene silencing, and RNAi.},

  abstract = {This work presents a machine learning\textendash based method for transcriptome analysis via comparison of gene coexpression networks, which outperforms traditional statistical tests at identifying stress-related genes. Analysis of an Arabidopsis stress expression data set led to the prediction of candidate stress-related genes showing expression and network changes in response to multiple abiotic stresses., Machine learning () is an intelligent data mining technique that builds a prediction model based on the learning of prior knowledge to recognize patterns in large-scale data sets. We present an ML-based methodology for transcriptome analysis via comparison of gene coexpression networks, implemented as an R package called machine learning\textendash based differential network analysis () and apply this method to reanalyze a set of abiotic stress expression data in Arabidopsis thaliana. The  first used a -based filtering process to remove nonexpressed, constitutively expressed, or non-stress-responsive ``noninformative'' genes prior to network construction, through learning the patterns of 32 expression characteristics of known stress-related genes. The retained ``informative'' genes were subsequently analyzed by -based network comparison to predict candidate stress-related genes showing expression and network differences between control and stress networks, based on 33 network topological characteristics. Comparative evaluation of the network-centric and gene-centric analytic methods showed that  substantially outperformed traditional statistical testing\textendash based differential expression analysis at identifying stress-related genes, with markedly improved prediction accuracy. To experimentally validate the  predictions, we selected 89 candidates out of the 1784 predicted salt stress\textendash related genes with available SALK T-DNA mutagenesis lines for phenotypic screening and identified two previously unreported genes, mutants of which showed salt-sensitive phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of the quality of genomic "data products" such as genome assemblies or gene sets is of critical importance in order to recognize possible issues and correct them during the generation of new data. It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single-copy orthologs derived from OrthoDB, BUSCO can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the BUSCO tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome-assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. BUSCO is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various BUSCO running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto-lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the BUSCO setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and BUSCO "plugin" workflows for performing common operations in genomics using BUSCO results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

Here, we resequenced a core collection comprising 419 accessions with 6.55-fold coverage depth and identified approximately 3.66 million SNPs for evaluating the genomic variation. We performed phenotyping across 12 environments and conducted genome-wide association study of 13 fiber-related traits. 7,383 unique SNPs were significantly associated with these traits and were located within or near 4,820 genes; more associated loci were detected for fiber quality than fiber yield, and more fiber genes were detected in the D than the A subgenome. Several previously undescribed causal genes for days to flowering, fiber length, and fiber strength were identified. Phenotypic selection for these traits increased the frequency of elite alleles during domestication and breeding.

  abstract = {Phenotypic characterization of the Arabidopsis thaliana transparent testa12 (tt12) mutant encoding a membrane protein of the multidrug and toxic efflux transporter family, suggested that TT12 is involved in the vacuolar accumulation of proanthocyanidin precursors in the seed. Metabolite analysis in tt12 seeds reveals an absence of flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins together with a reduction of the major flavonol quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside. The TT12 promoter is active in cells synthesizing proanthocyanidins. Using translational fusions between TT12 and green fluorescent protein, it is demonstrated that this transporter localizes to the tonoplast. Yeast vesicles expressing TT12 can transport the anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in the presence of MgATP but not the aglycones cyanidin and epicatechin. Inhibitor studies demonstrate that TT12 acts in vitro as a cyanidin-3-O-glucoside/H(+)-antiporter. TT12 does not transport glycosylated flavonols and procyanidin dimers, and a direct transport activity for catechin-3-O-glucoside, a glucosylated flavan-3-ol, was not detectable. However, catechin-3-O-glucoside inhibited TT12-mediated transport of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in a dose-dependent manner, while flavan-3-ol aglycones and glycosylated flavonols had no effect on anthocyanin transport. It is proposed that TT12 transports glycosylated flavan-3-ols in vivo. Mutant banyuls (ban) seeds accumulate anthocyanins instead of proanthocyanidins, yet the ban tt12 double mutant exhibits reduced anthocyanin accumulation, which supports the transport data suggesting that TT12 mediates anthocyanin transport in vitro.},

An MS2T library of Arabidopsis metabolites was created from a set of MS/MS spectra acquired using the automatic data acquisition function of the mass spectrometer. By using this library, we obtained structural information for the detected peaks in the metabolic profile data without performing additional MS/MS analysis; this was achieved by searching for the corresponding MS2T accession in the library. In the case of metabolic profile data for Arabidopsis tissues containing more than 1000 peaks, approximately 50\% of the peaks were tagged by MS2Ts, and 90 peaks were identified or tentatively annotated with metabolite information by searching the metabolite databases and manually interpreting the MS2Ts. A comparison of metabolic profiles among the Arabidopsis tissues revealed that many unknown metabolites accumulated in a tissue-specific manner, some of which were deduced to be unusual Arabidopsis metabolites based on the MS2T data. Candidate genes responsible for these biosyntheses could be predicted by projecting the results to the transcriptome data. The method was also used for metabolic phenotyping of a subset of Ds transposon-inserted lines of Arabidopsis, resulting in clarification of the functions of reported genes involved in glycosylation of flavonoids. Thus, non-targeted metabolic profiling analysis using MS2T annotation methods could prove to be useful for investigating novel functions of secondary metabolites in plants.},

  abstract = {Forty years ago, 12-oxophytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) was reported as a prostaglandin (PG)-like metabolite of linolenic acid found in extracts of flaxseed. Since then, numerous studies have determined the role of 12-OPDA in regulating plant immunity, seed dormancy, and germination. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the regulation of 12-OPDA synthesis in the chloroplast and 12-OPDA-dependent signaling in gene expression and targeting protein functions. We describe the properties of OPDA that are linked to the activities of PGs, which are derived from arachidonic acid and act as tissue hormones in animals, including humans. The similarity of OPDA with bioactive PGs is particularly evident for the most-studied cyclopentenone, PG 15-dPGJ2. In addition to chemical approaches towards 12-OPDA synthesis, bio-organic synthesis strategies for 12-OPDA and analogous substances have recently been established. The resulting availability of OPDA will aid the identification of additional effector proteins, help in elucidating the mechanisms of OPDA sensing and transmission, and will foster the analysis of the physiological responses to OPDA in plants. There is a need to determine the compartmentation and transport of 12-OPDA and its conjugates, over long distances as well as short. It will be important to further study OPDA in animal and human cells, for example with respect to beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize stover is an important source of crop residues and a promising sustainable energy source in the United States. Stalk is the main component of stover, representing about half of stover dry weight. Characterization of genetic determinants of stalk traits provide a foundation to optimize maize stover as a biofuel feedstock. We investigated maize natural genetic variation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to detect candidate genes associated with traits related to stalk biomass (stalk diameter and plant height) and stalk anatomy (rind thickness, vascular bundle density and area). RESULTS: Using a panel of 942 diverse inbred lines, 899,784 RNA-Seq derived single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were identified. Stalk traits were measured on 800 members of the panel in replicated field trials across years. GWAS revealed 16 candidate genes associated with four stalk traits. Most of the detected candidate genes were involved in fundamental cellular functions, such as regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression. Two of the regulatory genes (Zmm22 and an ortholog of Fpa) that were associated with plant height were previously shown to be involved in regulating the vegetative to floral transition. The association of Zmm22 with plant height was confirmed using a transgenic approach. Transgenic lines with increased expression of Zmm22 showed a significant decrease in plant height as well as tassel branch number, indicating a pleiotropic effect of Zmm22. CONCLUSION: Substantial heritable variation was observed in the association panel for stalk traits, indicating a large potential for improving useful stalk traits in breeding programs. Genome-wide association analyses detected several candidate genes associated with multiple traits, suggesting common regulatory elements underlie various stalk traits. Results of this study provide insights into the genetic control of maize stalk anatomy and biomass.},

  abstract = {The regulation of gene expression is critical for organismal function and is an important source of phenotypic diversity between species. Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for regulatory divergence is therefore expected to provide insight into evolutionary change. Using deep sequencing, we quantified total and allele-specific mRNA expression levels genome-wide in two closely related Drosophila species (D. melanogaster and D. sechellia) and their F(1) hybrids. We show that 78\% of expressed genes have divergent expression between species, and that cis- and trans-regulatory divergence affects 51\% and 66\% of expressed genes, respectively, with 35\% of genes showing evidence of both. This is a relatively larger contribution of trans-regulatory divergence than was expected based on prior studies, and may result from the unique demographic history of D. sechellia. Genes with antagonistic cis- and trans-regulatory changes were more likely to be misexpressed in hybrids, consistent with the idea that such regulatory changes contribute to hybrid incompatibilities. In addition, cis-regulatory differences contributed more to divergent expression of genes that showed additive rather than nonadditive inheritance. A correlation between sequence similarity and the conservation of cis-regulatory activity was also observed that appears to be a general feature of regulatory evolution. Finally, we examined regulatory divergence that may have contributed to the evolution of a specific trait--divergent feeding behavior in D. sechellia. Overall, this study illustrates the power of mRNA sequencing for investigating regulatory evolution, provides novel insight into the evolution of gene expression in Drosophila, and reveals general trends that are likely to extend to other species.},

To explore circRNAs systematically, we sequenced and computationally analysed human, mouse and nematode RNA. We detected thousands of well-expressed, stable circRNAs, often showing tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. Sequence analysis indicated important regulatory functions for circRNAs. We found that a human circRNA, antisense to the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as), is densely bound by microRNA (miRNA) effector complexes and harbours 63 conserved binding sites for the ancient miRNA miR-7. Further analyses indicated that CDR1as functions to bind miR-7 in neuronal tissues. Human CDR1as expression in zebrafish impaired midbrain development, similar to knocking down miR-7, suggesting that CDR1as is a miRNA antagonist with a miRNA-binding capacity ten times higher than any other known transcript. Together, our data provide evidence that circRNAs form a large class of post-transcriptional regulators. Numerous circRNAs form by head-to-tail splicing of exons, suggesting previously unrecognized regulatory potential of coding sequences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Drought stress is one of the main abiotic stresses that affect crops. It leads to biochemical changes that can have adverse effects on plant growth, development and productivity. African eggplants are important vegetable and fruit crops reported to adapt and thrive well under drought stress. The diversified metabolites arising due to stress have not been well defined. A gas chromatographic\textendash mass spectrometric metabolomic approach was applied to characterize the effect of drought stress on metabolites at different stages of growth. Nineteen accessions were selected for analysis and drought was imposed by withholding water until soil moisture reached 60\% field capacity. Fresh leaf tissues were sampled before stress, 2 and 4 weeks after stress and metabolite profiling done. RESULTS Significant changes in metabolite content were observed, and potentially important metabolites with respect to stress responses were characterized. Proline, glutamate, sucrose, fructose and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites were shown to be positively correlated with stress. Principal component analysis showed a clear discrimination between the different accessions, growth stages and stress/control conditions. CONCLUSION The results illustrate that drought stress has a significant impact on the concentrations of some metabolites, such as amino acids, sugars and organic acids, which may contribute to drought stress effects and tolerance. \textcopyright{} 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {With the rapid adoption of high-throughput omic approaches to analyze biological samples such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, each analysis can generate tera- to peta-byte sized data files on a daily basis. These data file sizes, together with differences in nomenclature among these data types, make the integration of these multi-dimensional omics data into biologically meaningful context challenging. Variously named as integrated omics, multi-omics, poly-omics, trans-omics, pan-omics or shortened to just `omics', the challenges include differences in data cleaning, normalization, biomolecule identification, data dimensionality reduction, biological contextualization, statistical validation, data storage and handling, sharing and data archiving. The ultimate goal is toward the holistic realization of a `systems biology' understanding of the biological question. Commonly used approaches are currently limited by the 3 i's \textendash{} integration, interpretation and insights. Post integration, these very large datasets aim to yield unprecedented views of cellular systems at exquisite resolution for transformative insights into processes, events and diseases through various computational and informatics frameworks. With the continued reduction in costs and processing time for sample analyses, and increasing types of omics datasets generated such as glycomics, lipidomics, microbiomics and phenomics, an increasing number of scientists in this interdisciplinary domain of bioinformatics face these challenges. We discuss recent approaches, existing tools and potential caveats in the integration of omics datasets for development of standardized analytical pipelines that could be adopted by the global omics research community.},

  abstract = {Our previous findings on the screening of a large-pool of activation tagged rice plants grown under limited water conditions revealed the activation of Ribosomal Protein Large (RPL) subunit genes, RPL6 and RPL23A in two mutants that exhibited high water-use efficiency (WUE) with the genes getting activated by the integrated 4x enhancers (Moin et al., 2016a). In continuation of these findings, we have comprehensively characterized the Ribosomal Protein (RP) gene family including both small (RPS) and large (RPL) subunits, which have been identified to be encoded by at least 70 representative genes; RP-genes exist as multiple expressed copies with high nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity. The differential expression of all the representative genes in rice was performed under limited water and drought conditions at progressive time intervals in the present study. More than 50\% of the RP genes were upregulated in both shoot and root tissues. Some of them exhibited an overlap in the upregulation under both the treatments indicating that they might have a common role in inducing tolerance under limited water and drought conditions. Among the genes that became significantly upregulated in both the tissues and under both the treatments are RPL6, 7, 23A, 24 and 31 and RPS4, 10 and 18a. To further validate the role of RP genes in WUE and inducing tolerance to other stresses, we have raised transgenic plants overexpressing RPL23A in rice. The high expression lines of RPL23A exhibited low {$\Delta$}13C, increased quantum efficiency along with suitable growth and yield parameters with respect to negative control under the conditions of limited water availability. The constitutive expression of RPL23A was also associated with transcriptional upregulation of many other RPL and RPS genes. The seedlings of RPL23A high expression lines also showed a significant increase in fresh weight, root length, proline and chlorophyll contents under simulated drought and salt stresses. Taken together, our findings provide a secure basis for the RPL gene family expression as a potential resource for exploring abiotic stress tolerant properties in rice.},

  abstract = {Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) efficiently synthesizes the antifungal phytoalexin camalexin without the apparent release of bioactive intermediates, such as indole-3-acetaldoxime, suggesting that the biosynthetic pathway of this compound is channeled by the formation of an enzyme complex. To identify such protein interactions, we used two independent untargeted coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) approaches with the biosynthetic enzymes CYP71B15 and CYP71A13 as baits and determined that the camalexin biosynthetic P450 enzymes copurified with these enzymes. These interactions were confirmed by targeted co-IP and F\"orster resonance energy transfer measurements based on fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FRET-FLIM). Furthermore, the interaction of CYP71A13 and Arabidopsis P450 Reductase1 was observed. We detected increased substrate affinity of CYP79B2 in the presence of CYP71A13, indicating an allosteric interaction. Camalexin biosynthesis involves glutathionylation of the intermediary indole-3-cyanohydrin, which is synthesized by CYP71A12 and especially CYP71A13. FRET-FLIM and co-IP demonstrated that the glutathione transferase GSTU4, which is coexpressed with Trp- and camalexin-specific enzymes, is physically recruited to the complex. Surprisingly, camalexin concentrations were elevated in knockout and reduced in GSTU4-overexpressing plants. This shows that GSTU4 is not directly involved in camalexin biosynthesis but rather plays a role in a competing mechanism.},

  abstract = {The 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA)-binding protein is a putative negative regulator of polar auxin transport that has been shown to block auxin efflux from both whole plant tissues and microsomal membrane vesicles. We previously showed that NPA is hydrolyzed by plasma-membrane amidohydrolases that co-localize with tyrosine, proline, and tryptophan-specific aminopeptidases (APs) in the cotyledonary node, hypocotyl-root transition zone and root distal elongation zone of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seedlings. Moreover, amino acyl-beta-naphthylamide (aa-NA) conjugates resembling NPA in structure have NPA-like inhibitory activity on growth, suggesting a possible role of APs in NPA action. Here we report that the same aa-NA conjugates and the AP inhibitor bestatin also block auxin efflux from seedling tissue. Bestatin and, to a lesser extent, some aa-NA conjugates were more effective inhibitors of low-affinity specific [3H]NPA-binding than were the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol but had no effect on high-affinity binding. Since the APs are inhibited by flavonoids, we compared the localization of endogenous flavonoids and APs in seedling tissue. A correlation between AP and flavonoid localization was found in 5- to 6-d-old seedlings. Evidence that these flavonoids regulate auxin accumulation in vivo was obtained using the flavonoid-deficient mutant, tt4. In whole-seedling [14C]indole-3-acetic acid transport studies, the pattern of auxin distribution in the tt4 mutant was shown to be altered. The defect appeared to be in auxin accumulation, as a considerable amount of auxin escaped from the roots. Treatment of the tt4 mutant with the missing intermediate naringenin restored normal auxin distribution and accumulation by the root. These results implicate APs and endogenous flavonoids in the regulation of auxin efflux.},

  abstract = {Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a deadly cancer with high mortality rate, especially in economically advanced countries, while Barrett's esophagus (BE) is reported to be a precursor that strongly increases the risk of EAC. Due to the complexity of these diseases, their molecular mechanisms have not been revealed clearly. This study aims to explore the gene signatures shared between BE and EAC based on integrated network analysis. We obtained EAC- and BE-associated microarray datasets GSE26886, GSE1420, GSE37200, and GSE37203 from the Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress using systematic meta-analysis. These data were accompanied by clinical data and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis were conducted to explore the relationship between gene sets and clinical traits as well as to discover the key relationships behind the co-expression modules. A differentially expressed gene-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex was used to extract hub genes through Cytoscape plugins. As a result, 403 DEGs were excavated, comprising 236 upregulated and 167 downregulated genes, which are involved in the cell cycle and replication pathways. Forty key genes were identified using modules of MCODE, CytoHubba, and CytoNCA with different algorithms. A dark-gray module with 207 genes was identified which having a high correlation with phenotype (gender) in the WGCNA. Furthermore, five shared hub gene signatures (SHGS), namely, pre-mRNA processing factor 4 (PRPF4), serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM), DExH-Box Helicase 9 (DHX9), and origin recognition complex subunit 2 (ORC2), were identified between BE and EAC. SHGS enrichment denotes that RNA metabolism and splicosomes play a key role in esophageal cancer development and progress. We conclude that the PPI complex and WGCNA co-expression network highlight the importance of phenotypic identifying hub gene signatures for BE and EAC.},

Flavonoids could also be enhanced by blue (420\textendash 490 nm) or green (490\textendash 585 nm) light. Flavonoids act as antioxidants and shielding components in the plant's response to UV-B exposure. They are shown to quench singlet oxygen and to be reactive to hydroxyl radical. The aim was to determine whether treatment with blue or green light can alter flavonoid profiles after pre-exposure to UV-B and whether they cause corresponding biological effects in Brassicaceae sprouts. Based on their different flavonoid profiles, three vegetables from the Brassicaceae were selected. Sprouts were treated with five subsequent doses (equals 5 days) of moderate UV-B (0.23 kJ m\textendash 2 day\textendash 1 UV-BBE), which was followed with two subsequent (equals 2 days) doses of either blue (99 {$\mu$}mol m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1) or green (119 {$\mu$}mol m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1) light. In sprouts of kale, kohlrabi, and rocket salad, flavonoid glycosides were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn. Both Brassica oleracea species, kale and kohlrabi, showed mainly acylated quercetin and kaempferol glycosides. In contrast, in rocket salad, the main flavonol glycosides were quercetin glycosides. Blue light treatment after the UV-B treatment showed that quercetin and kaempferol glycosides were increased in the B. oleracea species kale and kohlrabi while\textemdash contrary to this\textemdash in rocket salad, there were only quercetin glycosides increased. Blue light treatment in general stabilized the enhanced concentrations of flavonoid glycosides while green treatment did not have this effect. Blue light treatment following the UV-B exposure resulted in a trend of increased singlet oxygen scavenging for kale and rocket. The hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity was independent from the light quality except for kale where an exposure with UV-B followed by a blue light treatment led to a higher hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity. These results underline the importance of different light qualities for the biosynthesis of reactive oxygen species that intercept secondary plant metabolites, but also show a pronounced species-dependent reaction, which is of special interest for growers.},

Four scrambled transcripts were identified, each involving a different pair of exons. The scrambled transcripts were found at relatively low levels in a variety of normal and neoplastic cells of rodent and human origin, primarily in the nonpolyadenylated component of cytoplasmic RNA. These results demonstrate that the splicing process does not always pair sequential exons in the order predicted from their positions in genomic DNA, thus creating a novel type of RNA product.},

They arise from plant secondary metabolism through condensation of phenylalanine derived from the shikimate pathway with malonyl-CoA obtained from citrate that is produced by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, leading to the formation of the key precursor in the flavonoids biosynthesis: the naringenin chalcone. The exact nature of the molecular species that undergo polymerization and the mechanism of assembly in proanthocyanidins are still unknown. From a structural point of view, flavanols comprise a C15 (C6-C3-C6) general structure composed by a benzopyran moiety (A and C rings) with an additional aromatic ring (B ring) linked to carbon C-2 of C ring. Flavanols are present in nature in monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric forms and differ from each other essentially in the configuration of carbon C-2, the hydroxylation/methoxylation pattern of the rings, the type of linkage between each unit, and the degree of galloylation. Flavanols in foods are described to present several beneficial effects such as antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties and also contribute to the sensory properties of some food products, such as astringency and color. Some of these aspects are discussed herein.},

To do this, we provide a general introduction to the T-DNA insertional sequence-indexed mutant collections with a focus on how best to use the available data sources for good line selection. As isolation of a homozygous line is a common next step once a potential disruption line has been identified, the second half of the chapter provides a step-by-step guide for the design and implementation of a T-DNA genotyping pipeline. Finally, we describe interpretation of genotyping results and include a troubleshooting section for common types of segregation distortions that we have observed. In this chapter we introduce both basic concepts and specific applications to both new and more experienced users of the collections for the design and implementation of small- to large-scale genotyping pipelines.},

Blood obstruction contributes to blood vessel stenosis, ischemia, and heart attack. At present, it is vital to find new targets for the development of safer and more effective antiplatelet agents. A diet rich in bioactive compounds can help in the prevention of cardiovascular events since it has been shown that some of these metabolites can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic disease by inhibiting platelet aggregation. This review aims to collect and discuss the largest amount of information reported updated on the cardioprotective and antiplatelet activities of the different bioactive compounds extracted from natural products. The compounds were divided into different groups (phenolic acids, flavonoids, carotenoids (lycopene and B-carotenes), and sulfides. Myricetin, a natural flavonoid present in berries, nuts, and green tea, is well-known for its anticancer properties. Even though several previous studies have reported the anticancer effects induced by myricetin, these effects have not yet been confirmed in the adenocarcinoma gastric cell line (AGS). Moreover, the exact mechanisms of myricetin-induced apoptosis and autophagy have not been clearly identified either. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the role of myricetin in inducing apoptosis and autophagy in AGS gastric cancer cells. First, the survival rate of AGS gastric cancer cells was assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. Thereafter, the rate of apoptosis was analyzed using4{${'}$},6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining as well as annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, and the expression of the proteins associated with apoptosis, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and autophagy was examined by western blotting. We observed that myricetin reduced the survival rate of AGS gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby inducing apoptosis and autophagy. Similar results were also obtained in vivo, and tumor growth was inhibited. Therefore, in the AGS gastric cancer cells, myricetin seems to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which in turn leads to apoptosis in vitroand in vivo, cell-protective autophagy, as well as inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. These results indicate the potential of myricetin as a natural anticancer agent. The rapid transmission of the pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged as an entire worldwide health concern and it was declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a consequence of the increasing reported infections number. COVID-19 disease is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and unfortunatly no drugs are currently approved against this desease. Accordingly, it is of outmost importance to review the possible therapeutic effects of naturally-occuring compounds that showed approved antiviral activities. The molecular docking approach offers a rapid prediction of a possible inhibition of the main enzymes Mpro and RdRp that play crucial role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription. In the present work, we review the anti-viral activities of polyphenol compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids and stilbene) derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal Vitis amurensis. Recent molecular docking studies reported the possible binding of these polyphenols on SARS-CoV-2 enzymes Mpro and RdRp active sites and showed interesting inhibitory effects. This antiviral activity was explained by the structure-activity relationships of the studied compounds. Also, pharmacokinetic analysis of the studied molecules is simulated in the present work. Among the studied polyphenol compounds, only five, namely caffeic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, naringenin and catechin have drug-likeness characteristics. These five polyphenols derived from Vitis amurensis are promising drug candidates for the COVID-19 treatment. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the in vitro anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties of four underutilized ethno-medicinal plants viz. Apluda mutica, Mikania micrantha, Kyllinga nemoralis and Cleome rutidosperma, growing in different parts of West Bengal, India. The anti-oxidant properties were evaluated using four different solvent extracts. The 70\% aq. ethanol extract of investigated plant samples were found to have adequate quantities of total phenolic (141.94{$\pm$}0.67-230.45{$\pm$}0.12 mg GAE/g dry extract), total flavonoid (23.27{$\pm$}0.04-71.05 {$\pm$}0.06 mg RE/ g dry extract) and anti-oxidant capacities documented by DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, reducing power, anti-lipid peroxidation and metal chelating activities. The 70\% aq. ethanol extracts of the plants showed most promising antioxidant activity and were investigated for phenolics quantification by HPLC, anti-diabetic properties by assessing {$\alpha$}-amylase, {$\alpha$}-glucosidase inhibitory activities and anti-inflammatory capabilities by protein denaturation inhibition. HPLC studies revealed the presence of several phenolic acids and flavonoids in variable levels. M. micrantha exhibited {$\alpha$}- amylase inhibition (IC50=58.44 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL), which was comparable to that of standard acarbose (IC50 = 53.80 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL). The maximum inhibition of protein denaturation was observed in M. micrantha (IC50=89.27 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL) followed by K. nemoralis (IC50 = 98.78 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL). The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clear separation among the wild plants under investigation. The outcomes demonstrate that these plants were shown to contain a remarkable amount of different bioactive compounds, hence affirming their contribution in several biological activities and to serve as a potential anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic agent in food and pharmaceutical industries. Myricetin (MYR) shows a lot of pharmacological activity such as antioxidant capacity and antitumor activity. However, the poor aqueous solubility of MYR (2 {$\mu$}g/mL) limits its pharmaceutical applications. To improve the dissolution rate of MYR, microparticles and inclusion complexes of MYR were successfully prepared by supercritical antisolvent (SAS) technology. The effects of the drug concentration, temperature, pressure, CO2 and solution volumetric feeding rate on the formation of MYR microparticles and the MYR/hydroxypropyl-{$\beta$}-cyclodextrin (HP-{$\beta$}-CD) complex microparticles were investigated systematically. The physical and chemical properties of the MYR microparticles were characterized by SEM, DSC, FTIR and XRD. After SAS processed, the particle size of MYR microparticles decreased and the crystal form of MYR changed due to the complexation with HP-{$\beta$}-CD, which lead to enhanced solubility, dissolution rate and further improve the antioxidant activity and antitumor activity. Bryophyllum constitutes a subgenus within the genus Kalanchoe that contains several plant species used in traditional medicine worldwide for the treatment of several diseases. However, little is known about the phytoconstituents of Bryophyllum spp. and previous reports have pointed at their low in Planta concentrations of bioactive compounds. In this work, we take advantage of plant in vitro culture for the study of the phenolic compounds found in the aerial parts of Bryophyllum spp. and their associated bioactivities. Our results show that the induction of nutritional stress leads to an improved accumulation of phenolic compounds, mainly flavonols and anthocyanins, represented by myricetin and malvidin glycosides, respectively. This effect is mainly found for B. \texttimes{} houghtonii, whose hydroethanolic extracts promoted the highest antioxidant, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities. In the case of cytotoxic activity, Bryophyllum extracts showed an enhanced activity against the MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell line. Meanwhile, extracts from B. daigremontianum promoted a wide range of effectiveness against different bacterial and fungal strains. This study is committed to shed light about the phytochemical potential associated to this unexplored subgenus, with the aim of considering Bryophyllum spp. as a valuable source of bioactive compounds for their exploitation in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.},

  abstract = {Obesity has become one of the major threats to human health across the globe. The rhizomes of Polygonatum sibiricum have shown promising anti-obesity effect. However, the metabolic and genetic basis mediating this beneficial effect are not fully resolved. It is well known that older rhizomes of P. sibiricum exert stronger pharmacological effects. Here, we performed high-resolution metabolome profiling of P. sibiricum rhizomes at different growth stages, and identified that three candidate anti-obesity metabolites, namely phloretin, linoleic acid and {$\alpha$}-linolenic acid, accumulated more in adult rhizomes. To elucidate the genetic basis controlling the accumulation of these metabolites, we performed transcriptome profiling of rhizomes from juvenile and adult P. sibiricum. Through third-generation long-read sequencing, we built a high-quality transcript pool of P. sibiricum, and resolved the genetic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of phloretin, linoleic acid and {$\alpha$}-linolenic acid. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of the genetic pathways in adult rhizomes, which likely lead to higher accumulation of these candidate metabolites. Overall, we identified several metabolic and genetic signatures related to the anti-obesity effect of P. sibiricum. The metabolic and transcriptional datasets generated in this work could also facilitate future research on other beneficial effects of this medicinal plant.},

This enzyme also competes for flux into the 3-deoxy flavonoid branch pathway in some species. F3H genes are increasingly being used, often together with genes encoding other enzymes, to engineer flavonoid synthesis in microbes and plants. Although putative F3H genes have been cloned in a large number of plant species, only a handful have been functionally characterized. Here we describe the biochemical properties of the Arabidopsis thaliana F3H (AtF3H) enzyme and confirm the activities of gene products from four other plant species previously identified as having high homology to F3H. We have also investigated the surprising ``leaky'' phenotype of AtF3H mutant alleles, uncovering evidence that two related flavonoid enzymes, flavonol synthase (EC 1.14.11.23) and anthocyanidin synthase (EC 1.14.11.19), can partially compensate for F3H in vivo. These experiments further indicate that the absence of F3H in these lines enables the synthesis of uncommon 3-deoxy flavonoids in the Arabidopsis seed coat.},

These natural products are well known for their beneficial effects on health and efforts are being made to isolate the ingredients so called flavonoids. Flavonoids are now considered as an indispensable component in a variety of nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, medicinal and cosmetic applications. This is attributed to their anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic properties coupled with their capacity to modulate key cellular enzyme function. Research on flavonoids received an added impulse with the discovery of the low cardiovascular mortality rate and also prevention of CHD. Information on the working mechanisms of flavonoids is still not understood properly. However, it has widely been known for centuries that derivatives of plant origin possess a broad spectrum of biological activity. Current trends of research and development activities on flavonoids relate to isolation, identification, characterisation and functions of flavonoids and finally their applications on health benefits. Molecular docking and knowledge of bioinformatics are also being used to predict potential applications and manufacturing by industry. In the present review, attempts have been made to discuss the current trends of research and development on flavonoids, working mechanisms of flavonoids, flavonoid functions and applications, prediction of flavonoids as potential drugs in preventing chronic diseases and future research directions.},

  abstract = {The quality of cotton fiber is determined by its final length and strength, which is a function of primary and secondary cell wall deposition. Using a comparative proteomics approach, we identified 104 proteins from cotton ovules 10 days postanthesis with 93 preferentially accumulated in the wild type and 11 accumulated in the fuzzless-lintless mutant. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that nucleotide sugar metabolism was the most significantly up-regulated biochemical process during fiber elongation. Seven protein spots potentially involved in pectic cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis were specifically accumulated in wild-type samples at both the protein and transcript levels. Protein and mRNA expression of these genes increased when either ethylene or lignoceric acid (C24:0) was added to the culture medium, suggesting that these compounds may promote fiber elongation by modulating the production of cell wall polymers. Quantitative analysis revealed that fiber primary cell walls contained significantly higher amounts of pectin, whereas more hemicellulose was found in ovule samples. Significant fiber growth was observed when UDP-l-rhamnose, UDP-d-galacturonic acid, or UDP-d-glucuronic acid, all of which were readily incorporated into the pectin fraction of cell wall preparations, was added to the ovule culture medium. The short root hairs of Arabidopsis uer1-1 and gae6-1 mutants were complemented either by genetic transformation of the respective cotton cDNA or by adding a specific pectin precursor to the growth medium. When two pectin precursors, produced by either UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose 3,5-epimerase 4-reductase or by UDP-d-glucose dehydrogenase and UDP-d-glucuronic acid 4-epimerase successively, were used in the chemical complementation assay, wild-type root hair lengths were observed in both cut1 and ein2-5 Arabidopsis seedlings, which showed defects in C24:0 biosynthesis or ethylene signaling, respectively. Our results suggest that ethylene and C24:0 may promote cotton fiber and Arabidopsis root hair growth by activating the pectin biosynthesis network, especially UDP-l-rhamnose and UDP-d-galacturonic acid synthesis.},

The distribution of these compounds is strongly correlated with the generally accepted genomic substructure of the genus. Among diploid species native to the Old World, weak links between the species of the A, B and F genome taxa can be inferred from the flavonoid data. The Arabian (E genome) and the Australian species groups mainly appear to be isolated from each other and from the rest of the genus, with the exception of the Australian G. bickii, which shows moderate affinities with species in several other genome groupings. Although there is great variation in the flavonoid patterns in species of the New World diploids of the D genome, there is a striking similarity between the Old World cultivated species and the yellow-flowered D species. The two major pigment patterns found in the tetraploid species of the AD genome are generally similar to patterns found in species of the A and D genomes.

In the present study, the transcriptomes of the reciprocal maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids B73\texttimes Mo17 and Mo17\texttimes B73 and their parental inbred lines B73 and Mo17 were surveyed in primary roots, early in the developmental manifestation of heterotic root traits. The application of statistical methods and a suitable experimental design established that 34,233 (i.e., 86\%) of all high-confidence maize genes were expressed in at least one genotype. Nearly 70\% of all expressed genes were differentially expressed between the two parents and 42\%-55\% of expressed genes were differentially expressed between one of the parents and one of the hybrids. In both hybrids, {$\sim$}10\% of expressed genes exhibited nonadditive gene expression. Consistent with the dominance model (i.e., complementation) for heterosis, 1124 genes that were expressed in the hybrids were expressed in only one of the two parents. For 65 genes, it could be shown that this was a consequence of complementation of genomic presence/absence variation. For dozens of other genes, alleles from the inactive inbred were activated in the hybrid, presumably via interactions with regulatory factors from the active inbred. As a consequence of these types of complementation, both hybrids expressed more genes than did either parental inbred. Finally, in hybrids, {$\sim$}14\% of expressed genes exhibited allele-specific expression (ASE) levels that differed significantly from the parental-inbred expression ratios, providing further evidence for interactions of regulatory factors from one parental genome with target genes from the other parental genome.},

  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) displays an exceptional level of structural genomic diversity, which is likely unique among higher eukaryotes. In this study, we surveyed how the genetic divergence of two maize inbred lines affects the transcriptomic landscape in four different primary root tissues of their F1-hybrid progeny. An extreme instance of complementation was frequently observed: genes that were expressed in only one parent but in both reciprocal hybrids. This single-parent expression (SPE) pattern was detected for 2341 genes with up to 1287 SPE patterns per tissue. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded that of their parents in each tissue by {$>$}400. SPE patterns are highly dynamic, as illustrated by their excessive degree of tissue specificity (80\%). The biological significance of this type of complementation is underpinned by the observation that a disproportionally high number of SPE genes (75 to 82\%) is nonsyntenic, as opposed to all expressed genes (36\%). These genes likely evolved after the last whole-genome duplication and are therefore younger than the syntenic genes. In summary, SPE genes shape the remarkable gene expression plasticity between root tissues and complementation in maize hybrids, resulting in a tissue-specific increase of active genes in F1-hybrids compared with their inbred parents.},

  abstract = {Abstract Exonic circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules generated by a process named back-splicing. circRNAs are highly abundant in eukaryotes, and many of them are evolutionary conserved. In metazoans, circular RNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, are highly stable, and accumulate with age in neural tissues. circRNA biogenesis can regulate the production of the linear RNA counterpart in cis as back-splicing competes with linear splicing. Recent reports also demonstrate functions for some circRNAs in trans: Certain circRNAs interact with microRNAs, some are translated, and circRNAs have been shown to regulate immune responses and behavior. Here, we review current knowledge about animal circRNAs and summarize new insights into potential circRNA functions, concepts of their origin, and possible future directions in the field.},

Flavonoids have been shown to modulate transport of the phytohormone auxin in addition to auxin-dependent tropic responses. However, flavonoids are not essential regulators of these processes because transport and tropic responses occur in their absence. Flavonoids modulate the activity of auxin-transporting P-glycoproteins and seem to modulate the activity of regulatory proteins such as phosphatases and kinases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that auxin transport mechanisms evolved in the presence of flavonoid compounds produced for the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and defense from herbivores and pathogens.},

Biochemical studies suggest that flavonoids interact with regulatory proteins rather than directly with the PIN auxin efflux facilitator proteins. Auxin transport is enhanced in the absence of flavonoids (transparent testa4 [tt4]) and reduced in the presence of excess flavonols (tt7 and tt3). Steady state PIN mRNA levels in roots inversely correlate with auxin movement in tt mutants. PIN gene transcription and protein localization in flavonoid-deficient mutants appear to be modulated by developmental cues and are auxin responsive. Modulation of PIN gene expression and protein distribution by localized auxin accumulations occurs in the wild type as well. Flavonoids inhibit auxin transport primarily at the shoot apex and root tip and appear to modulate vesicular cycling of PIN1 at the root tip. In some auxin-accumulating tissues, flavonoid increases and changes in flavonoid speciation are subsequent to auxin accumulation.},

Here, chromosome-scale genome sequences were obtained and assembled for two recently described wild species of tetraploid cotton, Gossypium ekmanianum [(AD)6, Ge] and Gossypium stephensii [(AD)7, Gs], and one early form of domesticated Gossypium hirsutum, race punctatum [(AD)1, Ghp]. Based on phylogenomic analysis, we provide a dated whole-genome level perspective for the evolution of the tetraploid Gossypium clade and resolved the evolutionary relationships of Gs, Ge, and domesticated G. hirsutum. We describe genomic structural variation that arose during Gossypium evolution and describe its correlates-including phenotypic differentiation, genetic isolation, and genetic convergence-that contributed to cotton biodiversity and cotton domestication. Presence/absence variation is prominent in causing cotton genomic structural variations. A presence/absence variation-derived gene encoding a phosphopeptide-binding protein is implicated in increasing fiber length during cotton domestication. The relatively unimproved Ghp offers the potential for gene discovery related to adaptation to environmental challenges. Expanded gene families enoyl-CoA {$\delta$} isomerase 3 and RAP2-7 may have contributed to abiotic stress tolerance, possibly by targeting plant hormone-associated biochemical pathways. Our results generate a genomic context for a better understanding of cotton evolution and for agriculture.},

  abstract = {Naturally allotetraploid cotton has been widely used as an ideal model to investigate gene expression remodeling as a consequence of polyploidization. However, the global gene pattern variation during early fiber development was unknown. In this study, through RNA-seq technology, we comprehensively investigated the expression patterns of homologous genes between allotetraploid cotton (G. hirsutum) and its diploid progenitors (G. arboreum and G. raimondii) at the fiber early development stage. In tetraploid cotton, genes showed expression level dominance (ELD) bias toward the A genome. This phenomenon was explained by the up-/downregulation of the homologs from the nondominant progenitor (D genome). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment results indicated that the ELD-A genes might be a prominent cause responsible for fiber property change through regulating the fatty acid biosynthesis/metabolism and microtubule procession, and the ELD-D genes might be involved in transcription regulation and stress inducement. In addition, the number and proportion of completely A- and D-subfunctionalized gene were similar at different fiber development stages. However, for neofunctionalization, the number and proportion of reactivated D-derived genes were greater than those of A at 3 and 5 DPA. Eventually, we found that some homologous genes belonging to several specific pathways might create novel asymmetric transcripts between two subgenomes during polyploidization and domestication process, further making the fiber property meet the human demands. Our study identified determinate pathways and their involved genes between allotetraploid cotton and their progenitors at early fiber development stages, providing new insights into the mechanism of cotton fiber evolution.},

MAX2 appears essential for the perception of the newly characterized phytohormone strigolactone, a negative regulator of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis. A reverse genetic screen for F-box protein mutants altered in their stress responses identified MAX2 as a component of plant defense. Here we show that MAX2 contributes to plant resistance against pathogenic bacteria. Interestingly, max2 mutant plants showed increased susceptibility to the bacterial necrotroph Pectobacterium carotovorum as well as to the hemi-biotroph Pseudomonas syringae but not to the fungal necrotroph Botrytis cinerea. max2 mutant phenotype was associated with constitutively increased stomatal conductance and decreased tolerance to apoplastic ROS but also with alterations in hormonal balance. Our results suggest that MAX2 previously characterized for its role in regulation of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis, and thus plant development also significantly influences plant disease resistance. We conclude that the increased susceptibility to P. syringae and P. carotovorum is due to increased stomatal conductance in max2 mutants promoting pathogen entry into the plant apoplast. Additional factors contributing to pathogen susceptibility in max2 plants include decreased tolerance to pathogen-triggered apoplastic ROS and alterations in hormonal signaling.},

  abstract = {The lack of high-throughput methods to analyze the adipose tissue protein composition limits our understanding of the protein networks responsible for age and diet related metabolic response. We have developed an approach using multiple-dimension liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and extended multiplexing (24 biological samples) with tandem mass tags (TMT) labeling to analyze proteomes of epididymal adipose tissues isolated from mice fed either low or high fat diet for a short or a long-term, and from mice that aged on low versus high fat diets. The peripheral metabolic health (as measured by body weight, adiposity, plasma fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests) deteriorated with diet and advancing age, with long-term high fat diet exposure being the worst. In response to short-term high fat diet, 43 proteins representing lipid metabolism (e.g. AACS, ACOX1, ACLY) and red-ox pathways (e.g. CPD2, CYP2E, SOD3) were significantly altered (FDR {$<$} 10\%). Long-term high fat diet significantly altered 55 proteins associated with immune response (e.g. IGTB2, IFIT3, LGALS1) and rennin angiotensin system (e.g. ENPEP, CMA1, CPA3, ANPEP). Age-related changes on low fat diet significantly altered only 18 proteins representing mainly urea cycle (e.g. OTC, ARG1, CPS1), and amino acid biosynthesis (e.g. GMT, AKR1C6). Surprisingly, high fat diet driven age-related changes culminated with alterations in 155 proteins involving primarily the urea cycle (e.g. ARG1, CPS1), immune response/complement activation (e.g. C3, C4b, C8, C9, CFB, CFH, FGA), extracellular remodeling (e.g. EFEMP1, FBN1, FBN2, LTBP4, FERMT2, ECM1, EMILIN2, ITIH3) and apoptosis (e.g. YAP1, HIP1, NDRG1, PRKCD, MUL1) pathways. Using our adipose tissue tailored approach we have identified both age-related and high fat diet specific proteomic signatures highlighting a pronounced involvement of arginine metabolism in response to advancing age, and branched chain amino acid metabolism in early response to high fat feeding.

Abscisic acid (ABA) treatment can reduce the drought-induced adverse impacts on plants. However, our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms behind ABA-mediated drought tolerance in pomegranates is still limited. In this study, we treated the pomegranates under drought stress with exogenous ABA of different concentrations (30, 60 and 90~{$\mu$}M) and found that, compared to those without treatment, ABA can improve pomegranate's growth condition and related physiological responding processes. We also performed comparative transcriptome analysis between the ABA-treated and untreated pomegranates to reveal the ABA-induced mechanisms in response to drought-stress. Our results showed that exogenous ABA application substantially enhanced pomegranate drought resistance by strengthening some metabolic pathways, such as brassinosteroid synthesis, peroxisome biogenesis, photosynthesis and hemicelluloses synthesis. Furthermore, the over-dose treatment of exogenous ABA was found to trigger ABA degradation process and a feedback loop in pomegranate to balances the ABA accumulation that exceeds the optimal ABA requirement, at the cost of suppressed growth process and stress resistance. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular regulation mechanisms underlying the ABA-mediated drought-stress resistance in pomegranates.},

  abstract = {Fatty acids are essential for membrane biosynthesis in all organisms and serve as signaling molecules in many animals. Here, we found that saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs; C20:0 to C30:0) exogenously applied in ovule culture medium significantly promoted cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fiber cell elongation, whereas acetochlor (2-chloro-N-[ethoxymethyl]-N-[2-ethyl-6-methyl-phenyl]-acetamide; ACE), which inhibits VLCFA biosynthesis, abolished fiber growth. This inhibition was overcome by lignoceric acid (C24:0). Elongating fibers contained significantly higher amounts of VLCFAs than those of wild-type or fuzzless-lintless mutant ovules. Ethylene nullified inhibition by ACE, whereas C24:0 was inactive in the presence of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor (l-[2-aminoethoxyvinyl]-glycine), indicating that VLCFAs may act upstream of ethylene. C24:0 induced a rapid and significant increase in ACO (for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase) transcript levels that resulted in substantial ethylene production. C24:0 also promoted Ser palmitoyltransferase expression at a later stage, resulting in increased sphingolipid biosynthesis. Application of C24:0 not only stimulated Arabidopsis thaliana root cell growth but also complemented the cut1 phenotype. Transgenic expression of Gh KCS13/CER6, encoding the cotton 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, in the cut1 background produced similar results. Promotion of Arabidopsis stem elongation was accompanied by increased ACO transcript levels. Thus, VLCFAs may be involved in maximizing the extensibility of cotton fibers and multiple Arabidopsis cell types, possibly by activating ethylene biosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of single-stranded closed RNA molecules that undergo a specific backsplicing from pre-mRNA. With the application of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, circRNAs are found to be widely expressed across species. Some functionally characterized circRNAs have critical roles in gene regulation through various actions, including sponging microRNAs and proteins as well as regulating transcription and splicing. Moreover, most circRNAs are aberrantly expressed in different cancer types, and some of them have been reported to play important roles in the development and progression of cancer. Given the lack of a 5{${'}$} cap structure and evidence of their ability to bind with ribosomes, circRNAs were generally considered as noncoding RNA. Notably, recent studies reported that endogenous circRNAs can be translated with a cap-independent manner, which redefines the functional roles of circRNA, further expanding the complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes. This review aims to re-evaluate the functions and roles of circRNA from the cancer perspective. It discusses the current understanding of circRNA functions, the emerging roles of circRNA in cancer, and the challenges of future studies.},

Low nitrogen (LN) promotes the growth of plant root system, allowing it to explore more nitrogen. However, whether circRNAs involved in the response to LN stress and the regulation of LN-promoted root growth in wheat remains unclear. METHODS: Two wheat varieties (LH9 and XN979) with contrasting root phenotypes to LN stress were used as materials to identify circRNAs under control and LN conditions by using high-throughput sequencing technology. RESULTS: Six differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) involved in the common response to LN stress and 23 DECs involved in the regulation of LN-promoted root growth were successfully identified. GO analysis of the DEC-host genes involved in the regulation of LN-promoted root growth showed that GO terms related to biological regulation, responses to stimuli and signalling were significantly enriched. Moreover, seven DECs were predicted to have miRNA binding sites and may serve as miRNA sponges to capture miRNAs from their target genes. CONCLUSIONS: LN stress altered the expression profiles of circRNAs in wheat. This is the first report of LN stress responsive circRNAs in plants. Our results provided new clues for investigating the functions of circRNAs in response to LN stress and in the regulation of LN-promoted wheat root growth.},

  abstract = {The plant hormone auxin, a master coordinator of development, regulates hypocotyl elongation during seedling growth. We previously identified the synthetic molecule RubNeddin 1 (RN1), which induces degradation of the AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) transcriptional repressors INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID-INDUCIBLE3 (IAA3) and IAA7 in planta and strongly promotes hypocotyl elongation. In the present study, we show that despite the structural similarity of RN1 to the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic-acid (2,4-D), direct treatments with these compounds in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) result in distinct effects, possibly due to enhanced uptake of RN1 and low-level, chronic release of 2,4-D from RN1 in planta. We confirm RN1-induced hypocotyl elongation occurs via specific TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT1 (TIR1)/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) receptor-mediated auxin signaling involving TIR1, AFB2, and AFB5. Using a transcriptome profiling strategy and candidate gene approach, we identify the genes ZINC FINGER OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA10 (ZAT10), ARABIDOPSIS TOXICOS EN LEVADURA31 (ATL31), and WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN33 (WRKY33) as being rapidly upregulated by RN1, despite being downregulated by 2,4-D treatment. RN1-induced expression of these genes also occurs via TIR1/AFB-mediated auxin signaling. Our results suggest both hypocotyl elongation and transcription of these genes are induced by RN1 via the promoted degradation of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressor IAA7. Moreover, these three genes, which are known to be stress-related, act in an inter-dependent transcriptional regulatory network controlling hypocotyl elongation. Together, our results suggest ZAT10, ATL31, and WRKY33 take part in a common gene network regulating hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis downstream of a selective auxin perception module likely involving TIR1, AFB2, and AFB5 and inducing the degradation of IAA7.},

  abstract = {Flavonol bisglycosides accumulate in plant vegetative tissues in response to abiotic stress, including simultaneous environmental perturbations (i.e. nitrogen deficiency and low temperature, NDLT), but disappear with recovery from NDLT. Previously, we determined that a recombinant Arabidopsis {$\beta$}-glucosidase (BGLU), BGLU15, hydrolyzes flavonol 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnosides and flavonol 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucosides, forming flavonol 7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnosides and flavonol aglycones, respectively. In this study, the transient expression of a BGLU15\textendash Cherry fusion protein in onion epidermal cells demonstrated that BGLU15 was localized to the apoplast. Analysis of BGLU15 T-DNA insertional inactivation lines (bglu15-1 and bglu15-2) revealed negligible levels of BGLU15 transcripts, whereas its paralogs BGLU12 and BGLU16 were expressed in wild-type and bglu15 plants. The recombinant BGLU16 did not hydrolyze quercetin 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnoside or rhamnosylated flavonols, but was active with the synthetic substrate, p-nitrophenyl-{$\beta$}-d-glucoside. In addition, shoots of both bglu15 mutants contained negligible flavonol 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnoside hydrolase activity, whereas this activity increased by 223\% within 2 d of NDLT recovery in wild-type plants. The levels of flavonol 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnosides and quercetin 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucoside were high and relatively unchanged in shoots of bglu15 mutants during recovery from NDLT, whereas rapid losses were apparent in wild-type shoots. Moreover, losses of two flavonol 3-O-{$\beta$}-neohesperidoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnosides and kaempferol 3-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnoside were evident during recovery from NDLT, regardless of whether BGLU15 was present. A spike in a kaempferol 7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnoside occurred with stress recovery, regardless of germplasm, suggesting a contribution from hydrolysis of kaempferol 3-O-{$\beta$}-neohesperidoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnosides and/or kaempferol 3-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnoside by hitherto unknown mechanisms. Thus, BGLU15 is essential for catabolism of flavonol 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucoside-7-O-{$\alpha$}-rhamnosides and flavonol 3-O-{$\beta$}-glucosides in Arabidopsis.},

A way to preserve phenotypic and genetic diversity is to re-evaluate traditional landraces to introduce their benefits to the broader public. Common onion genotypes vary greatly in their storability. In particular, temperature and relative humidity during storage have significant impact on the metabolites in onions after storage. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the metabolite profile of ten onion genotypes after five months of cold storage. In addition, a characterization of onion landraces in their fresh state was also conducted in order to compare their properties against a commercial genotype. Onion genotypes were grown under organic farming conditions. After harvest and curing, bulbs were stored for up to 22 weeks. Before and after storage, bulb samples were analyzed through targeted and untargeted methods. Out of 189 identified metabolites, 128 showed a storage effect. Mainly fructans decreased because of respiration and energy demand, while monosaccharides increased. Further, amino acids were altered in their concentration after storage with an effect on aroma precursors. Eight of the nine landraces had good storability without critical losses. In their fresh state, the onion genotypes clustered into three major groups. For instance, landraces of group III showed consistently and substantially higher levels of amino acids and certain sugars, indicating a high potential of aromatic properties in those onion landraces.},

  abstract = {Since the initial biochemical study of a putative invertase inhibitor half a century ago, it has remained as a puzzle as whether such an inhibitory protein indeed limits invertase activity in vivo and, if it does, what is the developmental or physiological significance of such an interaction? Recently, we demonstrated that an invertase inhibitor, INVINH1, specifically inhibited cell wall invertase activity in tomato and Arabidopsis. Silencing INVINH1 expression in tomato released a significant amount of extra cell wall invertase activity. This posttranslational elevation of invertase activity resulted in a blockage of ABA-induced leaf senescence and an increase in fruit sugar levels and seed weight. Here, we discuss the implication of the findings and propose a model that the invertse inhibitor may act as a key modulator in controlling leaf longevity and seed development to ensure success during plant evolution. This may be achieved by optimizing carbon and nitrogen allocation and sugar signaling via interaction between invertase and inhibitor. The discoveries open up exciting new areas for exploring fundamental questions in sugar signaling, carbon allocation and plant development as well as avenues for improving crop productivity.},

  abstract = {The effects of UVB radiation on plant growth rate, gene expression and flavonoid content in wild-type, and in transgenic and mutant F3{${'}$}H deficient Petunia lines have been studied for the first time. In wild-type Petunia, UVB induced an increase in total levels of flavonols and this was due to an up-regulation of several genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Furthermore, UVB induced a higher rate of production of dihydroxylated flavonols than mono-hydroxylated equivalents. Thus, the ratio of quercetin (ortho-dihydroxylated) to kaempferol (monohydroxylated) increased. In the F3H deficient mutant line, increasing UVB resulted in up-regulation of all of the basic flavonoid biosynthetic genes. Total flavonoids increased to levels significantly higher than in control plants, and the predominant flavonoid was kaempferol. The leaves of these plants grew at a significantly slower rate than comparably treated wild-type plants under ambient or enhanced UVB radiation. This suggests that the predominance of quercetin in the wild-type confers a protective advantage that is not matched in the mutant, even with higher overall flavonoid levels. In contrast, the antisense F3H construct produced an unexpected down-regulation of C4H, CHS and CHI transcription. This resulted in lower total flavonoid production in these plants. The growth rate of these plants was not impaired in UVB to a statistically significant extent, and the Q:K ratio did not change with increasing UVB radiation. This investigation has established a likely correlation between the effect of UVB on plant growth rate, the level of activity of the F3{${'}$}H gene, and the proposed photoprotection afforded by an increased Q:K ratio.},

  abstract = {Estrogens induce cell proliferation in target tissues by stimulating progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Induction of cyclin D1 expression is a critical feature of the mitogenic action of estrogen. We have determined a region between -96 and -29 in the cyclin D1 promoter that confers regulation by estrogens in the human mammary carcinoma cells MCF-7. This region encompasses a unique known transcription factor binding site with a sequence of a potential cAMP response element (CRE-D1). The induction is strictly hormone dependent and requires the DNA binding domain as well as both AF-1 and AF-2 domains of the estrogen receptor (ER) {$\alpha$}. Destruction of the CRE-D1 motif caused complete loss of estrogen responsiveness. Both c-Jun and ATF-2 transactivated the cyclin D1 promoter in transient transfection experiments, and a clear additional increase was detected when ER was cotransfected with either c-Jun or with c-Jun and ATF-2 but not with ATF-2 alone. Furthermore, the expression of a dominant negative variant of c-Jun, TAM67, completely abolished the induction of the cyclin D1 promoter both in the absence and presence of ER. We show that ATF-2 homodimers and ATF-2/c-Jun heterodimers, but not c-Jun homodimers, were able to bind the CRE of the cyclin D1 promoter. To interpret these results, we propose a mechanism in which ATF-2/c-Jun heterodimers bind to the CRE-D1 element and mediate the activation of cyclin D1 promoter by the ER. This mechanism represents a pathway by which estrogens control the proliferation of target cells.},

Both circular RNA-microRNA-mRNA network and MeJA treatment results in Ligonlintless-1 and wild-type might provide a strong indication of four circular RNAs and ghr\_miR169b being important biological molecular associating with fiber development. The results provide new insight into the putative molecular function of circular RNAs in the regulation of fiber development.},

Different processes can lead to diversification among duplicate genes, which may be counterbalanced by mechanisms that retard divergence, including gene conversion via nonreciprocal homoeologous exchange. Here, we used genomic resources in diploid and allopolyploid cotton (Gossypium) to detect homoeologous single nucleotide polymorphisms provided by expressed sequence tags from G. arboreum (A genome), G. raimondii (D genome) and G. hirsutum (AD genome), allowing us to identify homoeo-single nucleotide polymorphism patterns indicative of potential homoeologous exchanges. We estimated the proportion of contigs in G. hirsutum that have experienced nonreciprocal homoeologous exchanges since the origin of polyploid cotton 1-2 million years ago (Mya) to be between 1.8\% and 1.9\%. To address the question of when the intergenomic exchange occurred, we assayed six of the genes affected by homoeo-recombination in all five Gossypium allopolyploids using a phylogenetic approach. This analysis revealed that nonreciprocal homoeologous exchanges have occurred throughout polyploid divergence and speciation, as opposed to saltationally with polyploid formation. In addition, some genomic regions show multiple patterns of homoeologous recombination among species.},

  abstract = {In many flowering plants, xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Xyloglucan can be degraded by a suite of exoglycosidases that remove specific sugars. In this work, we show that the xyloglucan backbone, formed by (1\textrightarrow 4)-linked {$\beta$}-d-glucopyranosyl residues, can be attacked by two different Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) {$\beta$}-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 3. While BGLC1 (At5g20950; for {$\beta$}-glucosidase active against xyloglucan 1) is responsible for all or most of the soluble activity, BGLC3 (At5g04885) is usually a membrane-anchored protein. Mutations in these two genes, whether on their own or combined with mutations in other exoglycosidase genes, resulted in the accumulation of partially digested xyloglucan subunits, such as GXXG, GXLG, or GXFG. While a mutation in BGLC1 had significant effects on its own, lack of BGLC3 had only minor effects. On the other hand, double bglc1 bglc3 mutants revealed a synergistic interaction that supports a role for membrane-bound BGLC3 in xyloglucan metabolism. In addition, bglc1 bglc3 was complemented by overexpression of either BGLC1 or BGLC3. In overexpression lines, BGLC3 activity was concentrated in a microsome-enriched fraction but also was present in soluble form. Finally, both genes were generally expressed in the same cell types, although, in some cases, BGLC3 was expressed at earlier stages than BGLC1. We propose that functional specialization could explain the separate localization of both enzymes, as a membrane-bound {$\beta$}-glucosidase could specifically digest soluble xyloglucan without affecting the wall-bound polymer.},

Nearly 85\% of the genome is composed of hundreds of families of transposable elements, dispersed nonuniformly across the genome. These were responsible for the capture and amplification of numerous gene fragments and affect the composition, sizes, and positions of centromeres. We also report on the correlation of methylation-poor regions with Mu transposon insertions and recombination, and copy number variants with insertions and/or deletions, as well as how uneven gene losses between duplicated regions were involved in returning an ancient allotetraploid to a genetically diploid state. These analyses inform and set the stage for further investigations to improve our understanding of the domestication and agricultural improvements of maize.},

The latter aspect is supported by the recent identification of an Arabidopsis mutant with multicellular trichomes, the siamese mutant, suggesting that Arabidopsis trichomes are evolutionarily derived from multicellular forms. We speculate that the spatial information for branch formation is derived from mechanisms employed in cell divisions.},

Ovules cultured in the presence of 1 x 10-5 M oryzalin (a microtubule-disrupting agent) produced significantly fewer fibers. Treatment with 1 x 10-5 M taxol (a microtubule-stabilizing agent) induced ovules to produce significantly greater numbers of fibers. Chemical agents modifying the function of microfilaments (i.e., cytochalasin B or 3 maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxy succinimide ester [MBS]) reduced fiber production. All the treatments with cytoskeletal-disrupting agents induced changes in fiber morphology. There is a window of opportunity where cytoskeletal elements function in fiber initiation. Both the inhibition and stimulation of fiber production occur early in ovule development (between 1 and 3 days postanthesis). After this time, these chemical agents can induce alterations in fiber morphology but not in the number of fibers produced. These data indicate that cytoskeletal elements may play separate roles in fiber morphology and initiation mechanisms. Increases in fiber production with the application of taxol indicate that stabilizing microtubule arrays may stimulate epidermal cells to form fibers. Mimicking the taxol response through manipulation of microtubule chemistry may provide a mechanism for enhancing in vivo fiber production.},

  abstract = {Heterosis refers to a quantitative phenomenon in which F1 hybrid trait values exceed the mean of the parental values in a positive direction. Generally, it is dependent on a high degree of heterozygosity, which is maintained in hybrid breeding by developing parental lines in separate, genetically distinct heterotic groups. The mobility of small RNAs (sRNAs) that mediate epigenetic regulation of gene expression renders them promising candidates for modulating the action of combined diverse genomes in trans-and evidence already indicates their contribution to transgressive phenotypes. By sequencing small RNA libraries of a panel of 21 maize parental inbred lines we found a low overlap of 35\% between the sRNA populations from both distinct heterotic groups. Surprisingly, in contrast to genetic or gene expression variation, parental sRNA expression variation is negatively correlated with grain yield (GY) heterosis. Among 0.595 million expressed sRNAs, we identified 9,767, predominantly 22- and 24-nt long sRNAs, which showed an association of their differential expression between parental lines and GY heterosis of the respective hybrids. Of these sRNAs, 3,485 or 6,282 showed an association with high or low GY heterosis, respectively, thus the low heterosis associated group prevailing at 64\%. The heterosis associated sRNAs map more frequently to genes that show differential expression between parental lines than reference sets. Together these findings suggest that trans-chromosomal actions of sRNAs in hybrids might add up to a negative contribution in heterosis formation, mediated by unfavorable gene expression regulation. We further revealed an exclusive accumulation of 22-nt sRNAs that are associated with low GY heterosis in pericentromeric genomic regions. That recombinational suppression led to this enrichment is indicated by its close correlation with low recombination rates. The existence of this enrichment, which we hypothesize resulted from the separated breeding of inbred lines within heterotic groups, may have implications for hybrid breeding strategies addressing the recombinational constraints characteristic of complex crop genomes.},

Phenolics are produced under optimal and suboptimal conditions in plants and play key roles in developmental processes like cell division, hormonal regulation, photosynthetic activity, nutrient mineralization, and reproduction. Plants exhibit increased synthesis of polyphenols such as phenolic acids and flavonoids under abiotic stress conditions, which help the plant to cope with environmental constraints. Phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway is activated under abiotic stress conditions (drought, heavy metal, salinity, high/low temperature, and ultraviolet radiations) resulting in accumulation of various phenolic compounds which, among other roles, have the potential to scavenge harmful reactive oxygen species. Deepening the research focuses on the phenolic responses to abiotic stress is of great interest for the scientific community. In the present article, we discuss the biochemical and molecular mechanisms related to the activation of phenylpropanoid metabolism and we describe phenolic-mediated stress tolerance in plants. An attempt has been made to provide updated and brand-new information about the response of phenolics under a challenging environment.},

  abstract = {Heterosis is a fundamental biological phenomenon characterized by the superior performance of a hybrid compared with its parents. The underlying molecular basis for heterosis, particularly for allopolyploids, remains elusive. In this study we analyzed the transcriptomes of Brassica napus parental lines and their F1 hybrids at three stages of early flower development. Phenotypically, the F1 hybrids show remarkable heterosis in silique number and grain yield. Transcriptome analysis revealed that various phytohormone (auxin and salicylic acid) response genes are significantly altered in the F1 hybrids relative to the parental lines. We also found evidence for decreased expression divergence of the homoeologous gene pairs in the allopolyploid F1 hybrids and suggest that high-parental expression-level dominance plays an important role in heterosis. Small RNA and methylation studies aimed at examining the epigenetic effect of the changes in gene expression level in the F1 hybrids showed that the majority of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) clusters had a higher expression level in the F1 hybrids than in the parents, and that there was an increase in genome-wide DNA methylation in the F1 hybrid. Transposable elements associated with siRNA clusters had a higher level of methylation and a lower expression level in the F1 hybrid, implying that the non-additively expressed siRNA clusters resulted in lower activity of the transposable elements through DNA methylation in the hybrid. Our data provide insights into the role that changes in gene expression pattern and epigenetic mechanisms contribute to heterosis during early flower development in allopolyploid B. napus.},

Here, we develop a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that expands metabolite annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA is based on the rationale that seed metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors tend to share structural similarities resulting in similar MS2 spectra. MetDNA characterizes initial seed metabolites using a small library of MS2 spectra, and utilizes their experimental MS2 spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites, which subsequently serve as the basis for recursive analysis. Using different LC-MS platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological samples, we showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA and demonstrate that about 2000 metabolites can cumulatively be annotated from one experiment. Our results demonstrate that MetDNA substantially expands metabolite annotation, enabling quantitative assessment of metabolic pathways and facilitating integrative multi-omics analysis.},

  abstract = {Plants are natural experts in organic synthesis, being able to generate large numbers of specific metabolites with widely varying structures that help them adapt to variable survival challenges. Metabolomics is a research discipline that integrates the capabilities of several types of research including analytical chemistry, statistics, and biochemistry. Its ongoing development provides strategies for gaining a systematic understanding of quantitative changes in the levels of metabolites. Metabolomics is usually performed by targeting either a specific cell, a specific tissue, or the entire organism. Considerable advances in science and technology over the last three decades have propelled us into the era of multi-omics, in which metabolomics, despite at an earlier developmental stage than genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, offers the distinct advantage of studying the cellular entities that have the greatest influence on end phenotype. Here, we summarize the state of the art of metabolite detection and identification, and illustrate these techniques with four case study applications: (i) comparing metabolite composition within and between species, (ii) assessing spatio-temporal metabolic changes during plant development, (iii) mining characteristic metabolites of plants in different ecological environments and upon exposure to various stresses, and (iv) assessing the performance of metabolomics as a means of functional gene identification , metabolic pathway elucidation, and metabolomics-assisted breeding through analyzing plant populations with diverse genetic variations. In addition, we highlight the prominent contributions of joint analyses of plant metabolomics and other omics datasets, including those from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, phenomics, microbiomes, and ion-omics studies. Finally, we discuss future~directions and challenges exploiting metabolomics-centered approaches in understanding plant metabolic diversity.},

Here, utilizing a high-density genetic map, we conducted a comprehensive metabolome study via widely targeted LC-MS/MS to analyze the wheat kernel metabolism. We further combined agronomic traits and dissected the genetic relationship between metabolites and agronomic traits. In total, 1260 metabolic features were detected. Using linkage analysis, 1005 metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) were found distributed unevenly across the genome. Twenty-four candidate genes were found to modulate the levels of different metabolites, of which two were functionally annotated by in vitro analysis to be involved in the synthesis and modification of flavonoids. Combining the correlation analysis of metabolite-agronomic traits with the co-localization of methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) and phenotypic QTL (pQTL), genetic relationships between the metabolites and agronomic traits were uncovered. For example, a candidate was identified using correlation and co-localization analysis that may manage auxin accumulation, thereby affecting number of grains per spike (NGPS). Furthermore, metabolomics data were used to predict the performance of wheat agronomic traits, with metabolites being found that provide strong predictive power for NGPS and plant height. This study used metabolomics and association analysis to better understand the genetic basis of the wheat metabolism which will ultimately assist in wheat breeding.},

  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) seeds are a good source of protein, despite being deficient in several essential amino acids. However, eliminating the highly abundant but poorly balanced seed storage proteins has revealed that the regulation of seed amino acids is complex and does not rely on only a handful of proteins. In this study, we used two complementary omics-based approaches to shed light on the genes and biological processes that underlie the regulation of seed amino acid composition. We first conducted a genome-wide association study to identify candidate genes involved in the natural variation of seed protein-bound amino acids. We then used weighted gene correlation network analysis to associate protein expression with seed amino acid composition dynamics during kernel development and maturation. We found that almost half of the proteome was significantly reduced during kernel development and maturation, including several translational machinery components such as ribosomal proteins, which strongly suggests translational reprogramming. The reduction was significantly associated with a decrease in several amino acids, including lysine and methionine, pointing to their role in shaping the seed amino acid composition. When we compared the candidate gene lists generated from both approaches, we found a nonrandom overlap of 80 genes. A functional analysis of these genes showed a tight interconnected cluster dominated by translational machinery genes, especially ribosomal proteins, further supporting the role of translation dynamics in shaping seed amino acid composition. These findings strongly suggest that seed biofortification strategies that target the translation machinery dynamics should be considered and explored further.},

  abstract = {Hybrids are extensively used in agriculture to deliver an increase in yield, yet the molecular basis of heterosis is not well understood. Global DNA methylation analysis, transcriptome analysis and small RNA profiling were aimed to understand the epigenetic effect of the changes in gene expression level in the two hybrids and their parental lines. Increased DNA methylation was observed in both the hybrids as compared to their parents. This increased DNA methylation in hybrids showed that majority of the 24-nt siRNA clusters had higher expression in hybrids than the parents. Transcriptome analysis revealed that various phytohormones (auxin and salicylic acid) responsive hybrid-MPV DEGs were significantly altered in both the hybrids in comparison to MPV. DEGs associated with plant immunity and growth were overexpressed whereas DEGs associated with basal defence level were repressed. This antagonistic patterns of gene expression might contribute to the greater growth of the hybrids. It was also noticed that some common as well as unique changes in the regulatory pathways were associated with heterotic growth in both the hybrids. Approximately 70\% and 67\% of down-regulated hybrid-MPV DEGs were found to be differentially methylated in ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2740 hybrid, respectively. This reflected the association of epigenetic regulation in altered gene expressions. Our findings also revealed that miRNAs might play important roles in hybrid vigour in both the hybrids by regulating their target genes, especially in controlling plant growth and development, defence and stress response pathways. The above finding provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of pigeonpea heterosis.},

  abstract = {Gln is a key player in plant metabolism. It is one of the major free amino acids that is transported into the developing seed and is central for nitrogen metabolism. However, Gln natural variation and its regulation and interaction with other metabolic processes in seeds remain poorly understood. To investigate the latter, we performed a metabolic genome-wide association study (mGWAS) of Gln-related traits measured from the dry seeds of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) diversity panel using all potential ratios between Gln and the other members of the Glu family as traits. This semicombinatorial approach yielded multiple candidate genes that, upon further analysis, revealed an unexpected association between the aliphatic glucosinolates (GLS) and the Gln-related traits. This finding was confirmed by an independent quantitative trait loci mapping and statistical analysis of the relationships between the Gln-related traits and the presence of specific GLS in seeds. Moreover, an analysis of Arabidopsis mutants lacking GLS showed an extensive seed-specific impact on Gln levels and composition that manifested early in seed development. The elimination of GLS in seeds was associated with a large effect on seed nitrogen and sulfur homeostasis, which conceivably led to the Gln response. This finding indicates that both Gln and GLS play key roles in shaping the seed metabolic homeostasis. It also implies that select secondary metabolites might have key functions in primary seed metabolism. Finally, our study shows that an mGWAS performed on dry seeds can uncover key metabolic interactions that occur early in seed development.},

  abstract = {Thousands of species will be sequenced in the next few years; however, understanding how their genomes work, without an unlimited budget, requires both molecular and novel evolutionary approaches. We developed a sensitive sequence alignment pipeline to identify conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the Andropogoneae tribe (multiple crop species descended from a common ancestor {$\sim$}18 million years ago). The Andropogoneae share similar physiology while being tremendously genomically diverse, harboring a broad range of ploidy levels, structural variation, and transposons. These contribute to the potential of Andropogoneae as a powerful system for studying CNSs and are factors we leverage to understand the function of maize CNSs. We found that 86\% of CNSs were comprised of annotated features, including introns, UTRs, putative cis-regulatory elements, chromatin loop anchors, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and several transposable element superfamilies. CNSs were enriched in active regions of DNA replication in the early S phase of the mitotic cell cycle and showed different DNA methylation ratios compared to the genome-wide background. More than half of putative cis-regulatory sequences (identified via other methods) overlapped with CNSs detected in this study. Variants in CNSs were associated with gene expression levels, and CNS absence contributed to loss of gene expression. Furthermore, the evolution of CNSs was associated with the functional diversification of duplicated genes in the context of maize subgenomes. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the molecular processes governing the evolution of CNSs in maize.},

Recent studies have begun to unravel how the biogenesis of lncRNAs is distinct from that of mRNAs and is linked with their specific subcellular localizations and functions. Depending on their localization and their specific interactions with DNA, RNA and proteins, lncRNAs can modulate chromatin function, regulate the assembly and function of membraneless nuclear bodies, alter the stability and translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs and interfere with signalling pathways. Many of these functions ultimately affect gene expression in diverse biological and physiopathological contexts, such as in neuronal disorders, immune responses and cancer. Tissue-specific and condition-specific expression patterns suggest that lncRNAs are potential biomarkers and provide a rationale to target them clinically. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of lncRNA biogenesis, localization and functions in transcriptional, post-transcriptional and other modes of gene regulation, and their potential therapeutic applications.},

As absorption spectra of flavonoids are known to be severely pH-dependent, cellular pH will play a crucial role in flower coloration. The flavonoids are concentrated in the vacuoles of the flowers' epidermal cells, and thus the pigments' absorption spectra are modulated by the vacuolar pH. Here we study the pH dependence of flavonoid absorption spectra in extracts from flowers of two poppy species Papaver dubium (red) and Meconopsis cambrica (orange), and a white and red Mandevilla sanderi variety. In the red poppy and Mandevilla flowers, absorption spectra of the cyanidin- and pelargonidin-based anthocyanins peak in the blue-green-wavelength range at low pH, but exhibit a distinct bathochromic shift at higher pH. This shift to longer wavelengths is not found for the blue-absorbing nudicaulin derivatives of M. cambrica, which have a similar absorption spectrum at low and high pH. The pH-dependent absorption changes of the white M. sanderi's flavonoid remained restricted to the UV. An analysis of the spectra with logistic functions suggests that the pH-dependent characteristics of the basic states of flavonols and anthocyanins are related. The implications of tuning of pH and pigment absorption spectra for studies on flower color evolution are discussed.},

The ability of the enzyme to liberate sinapic acid from the donor molecule 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-glucose indicates the existence of a short-lived acylenzyme intermediate in the proposed random sequential bi-bi mechanism of catalysis. SMT-catalyzed formation of disinapoylglucose has been corroborated by docking studies with an established homology structure model that illustrates the possible binding of two 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-glucose molecules in the active site and the intermolecular reaction of the two glucose esters. The SMT gene is embedded in a tandem cluster of five SCPL sinapoyltransferase genes, which encode enzymes with high amino acid sequence identities and partially overlapping substrate specificities. We assume that in recent duplications of genes encoding SCPL proteins, neofunctionalization of the duplicates to accept 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-glucose as acyl donor was gained first, followed by subfunctionalization leading to different acyl acceptor specificities.},

We describe recessive mutations at two loci in Arabidopsis, MAX1 and MAX2, that affect the selective repression of axillary shoots. All the first order (but not higher order) axillary shoots initiated by mutant plants remain active, resulting in bushier shoots than those of wild type. In vegetative plants where axillary shoots develop in a basal to apical sequence, the mutations do not clearly alter node distance, from the shoot apex, at which axillary shoot meristems initiate but shorten the distance at which the first axillary leaf primordium is produced by the axillary shoot meristem. A small number of mutant axillary shoot meristems is enlarged and, later in development, a low proportion of mutant lateral shoots is fasciated. Together, this suggests that MAX1 and MAX2 do not control the timing of axillary meristem initiation but repress primordia formation by the axillary meristem. In addition to shoot branching, mutations at both loci affect leaf shape. The mutations at MAX2 cause increased hypocotyl and petiole elongation in light-grown seedlings. Positional cloning identifies MAX2 as a member of the F-box leucine-rich repeat family of proteins. MAX2 is identical to ORE9, a proposed regulator of leaf senescence ( Woo, H. R., Chung, K. M., Park, J.-H., Oh, S. A., Ahn, T., Hong, S. H., Jang, S. K. and Nam, H. G. (2001) Plant Cell 13, 1779-1790).

  abstract = {Plant roots nurture a tremendous diversity of microbes via exudation of photosynthetically fixed carbon sources. In turn, probiotic members of the root microbiome promote plant growth and protect the host plant against pathogens and pests. In the Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 model system the root-specific transcription factor MYB72 and the MYB72-controlled {$\beta$}-glucosidase BGLU42 emerged as important regulators of beneficial rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance (ISR) and iron-uptake responses. MYB72 regulates the biosynthesis of iron-mobilizing fluorescent phenolic compounds, after which BGLU42 activity is required for their excretion into the rhizosphere. Metabolite fingerprinting revealed the antimicrobial coumarin scopoletin as a dominant metabolite that is produced in the roots and excreted into the rhizosphere in a MYB72- and BGLU42-dependent manner. Shotgun-metagenome sequencing of root-associated microbiota of Col-0, myb72, and the scopoletin biosynthesis mutant f6'h1 showed that scopoletin selectively impacts the assembly of the microbial community in the rhizosphere. We show that scopoletin selectively inhibits the soil-borne fungal pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium dahliae, while the growth-promoting and ISR-inducing rhizobacteria P. simiae WCS417 and Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 are highly tolerant of the antimicrobial effect of scopoletin. Collectively, our results demonstrate a role for coumarins in microbiome assembly and point to a scenario in which plants and probiotic rhizobacteria join forces to trigger MYB72/BGLU42-dependent scopolin production and scopoletin excretion, resulting in improved niche establishment for the microbial partner and growth and immunity benefits for the host plant.},

Transposable elements are associated with adaptation to temperate climates in Drosophila, a SINE element is associated with the domestication of small dog breeds from the gray wolf and there is evidence that transposable elements were targets of selection during human evolution. Although the list of examples of transposable elements associated with host gene function continues to grow, proof that transposable elements are causative and not just correlated with functional variation is limited. Here we show that a transposable element (Hopscotch) inserted in a regulatory region of the maize domestication gene, teosinte branched1 (tb1), acts as an enhancer of gene expression and partially explains the increased apical dominance in maize compared to its progenitor, teosinte. Molecular dating indicates that the Hopscotch insertion predates maize domestication by at least 10,000 years, indicating that selection acted on standing variation rather than new mutation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrid progeny relative to the parental phenotypes. Maize exhibits heterosis for a wide range of traits, however the magnitude of heterosis is highly variable depending on the choice of parents and the trait(s) measured. We have used expression profiling to determine whether the level, or types, of non-additive gene expression vary in maize hybrids with different levels of genetic diversity or heterosis. RESULTS: We observed that the distributions of better parent heterosis among a series of 25 maize hybrids generally do not exhibit significant correlations between different traits. Expression profiling analyses for six of these hybrids, chosen to represent diversity in genotypes and heterosis responses, revealed a correlation between genetic diversity and transcriptional variation. The majority of differentially expressed genes in each of the six different hybrids exhibited additive expression patterns, and approximately 25\% exhibited statistically significant non-additive expression profiles. Among the non-additive profiles, approximately 80\% exhibited hybrid expression levels between the parental levels, approximately 20\% exhibited hybrid expression levels at the parental levels and \textasciitilde 1\% exhibited hybrid levels outside the parental range. CONCLUSION: We have found that maize inbred genetic diversity is correlated with transcriptional variation. However, sampling of seedling tissues indicated that the frequencies of additive and non-additive expression patterns are very similar across a range of hybrid lines. These findings suggest that heterosis is probably not a consequence of higher levels of additive or non-additive expression, but may be related to transcriptional variation between parents. The lack of correlation between better parent heterosis levels for different traits suggests that transcriptional diversity at specific sets of genes may influence heterosis for different traits.},

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  abstract = {The enzyme {$\beta$}-glucuronidase (GUS) is well characterized in animals and microbes. However, this enzyme is not well studied in plants and is widely assumed to be absent in them. In this study we document the ubiquitous presence of GUS in the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Nicotiana tabacum and Zea mays and record its expression pattern. The pH of the assay buffer was found to be critical with pH 4.0 being optimum for detection in all the species. GUS in plants appears to be associated with growth. In general, younger regions of the organs showed more GUS activity than the older and more mature tissues. In Brassica juncea roots stained for GUS, intense blue color could be seen in the trichoblast cells and the growing root hair cells as compared to the non-root hair forming epidermal cells or the fully elongated root hairs. Cotton fibers showed high GUS activity during the initial phase of elongation while the seed coat, from which the fibers formed, did not stain for GUS activity. The activity in the fibers disappeared after they were fully elongated. The level of GUS activity increased 2.58 folds in leaf tissues of N. tabacum when cultured in MS medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine, while gibberellic acid enhanced GUS activity 2.9 folds in the inter-nodal regions of rice in 12-h treatment. In addition, elongation of stem, root and root hairs in tobacco seedlings was strongly inhibited by the specific inhibitor of GUS, saccharo-1-4-lactone in a reversible manner. Taken together, these evidences suggest a probable association of plant GUS in cell growth.},

The engineered trait is robust as it improves yield in an inbred as well as in a panel of hybrids, at several locations and over multiple seasons in the field. Transcriptome studies, hormone measurements and the expression of the auxin responsive DR5rev:mRFPer marker suggest that PLA1 may function through an increase in auxin. Detailed analysis of growth over time demonstrates that PLA1 stimulates the duration of leaf elongation by maintaining dividing cells in a proliferative, undifferentiated state for a longer period of time. The prolonged duration of growth also compensates for growth rate reduction caused by abiotic stresses.},

In contrast to the well-established gibberellins pathway, oxidative modifications diversifying ent-kaurene skeleton in Isodon remain undetermined for a half century. Here, we report a chromosome-level genome of I. rubescens, a well-recognized oridonin producer long been favored by Asian people as a traditional herb with antitumour effects. The shoot apex was proposed to be the actual region actively producing ent-kaurene diterpenoids. Through comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses, we discovered a cluster of tandem-duplicated CYP706V oxygenase-encoding genes located on an ancient genomic block widely distributed in eudicots, whereas almost exclusively emerged in Isodon plants. In shoot apex, IrCYP706V2 and IrCYP706V7 oxidized ent-kaurene core in the initial stage of oridonin biosynthesis. Loss of CYP706Vs in the other Lamiaceae plants offered an explanation for the specific kaurenoid production in Isodon plants. Moreover, the presence of multiple diterpenoid synthases in the Isodon genome also revealed a great potential of generating diterpenoid diversity. These findings provided insights into the evolution of lineage-specific diterpenoid pathway, and laid a foundation of improving the production of bioactive ent-kaurene-type diterpenoids by molecular breeding and synthetic biology approaches.},

The latter finding suggests that multiple combinations between complementary sequences may facilitate the formation of the circular structure.

Using an estimated 15\% false discovery rate as a cutoff, 1,367 ESTs (9.8\%) were identified as being significantly differentially expressed among genotypes. All possible modes of gene action were observed, including additivity, high- and low-parent dominance, underdominance, and overdominance. The largest proportion of the ESTs (78\%; 1,062 of 1,367) exhibited expression patterns that are not statistically distinguishable from additivity. Even so, 22\% of the differentially regulated ESTs exhibited nonadditive modes of gene expression. Classified on the basis of significant pairwise comparisons of genotype means, 181 of these 305 nonadditive ESTs exhibited high-parent dominance and 23 exhibited low-parent dominance. In addition, 44 ESTs exhibited underdominance or overdominance. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple molecular mechanisms, including overdominance, contribute to heterosis.},

  abstract = {Through domestication, humans have substantially altered the morphology of Zea mays ssp. parviglumis (teosinte) into the currently recognizable maize. This system serves as a model for studying adaptation, genome evolution, and the genetics and evolution of complex traits. To examine how domestication has reshaped the transcriptome of maize seedlings, we used expression profiling of 18,242 genes for 38 diverse maize genotypes and 24 teosinte genotypes. We detected evidence for more than 600 genes having significantly different expression levels in maize compared with teosinte. Moreover, more than 1,100 genes showed significantly altered coexpression profiles, reflective of substantial rewiring of the transcriptome since domestication. The genes with altered expression show a significant enrichment for genes previously identified through population genetic analyses as likely targets of selection during maize domestication and improvement; 46 genes previously identified as putative targets of selection also exhibit altered expression levels and coexpression relationships. We also identified 45 genes with altered, primarily higher, expression in inbred relative to outcrossed teosinte. These genes are enriched for functions related to biotic stress and may reflect responses to the effects of inbreeding. This study not only documents alterations in the maize transcriptome following domestication, identifying several genes that may have contributed to the evolution of maize, but highlights the complementary information that can be gained by combining gene expression with population genetic analyses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Success of metabolomics as the phenotyping platform largely depends on its ability to detect various sources of biological variability. Removal of platform-specific sources of variability such as systematic error is therefore one of the foremost priorities in data preprocessing. However, chemical diversity of molecular species included in typical metabolic profiling experiments leads to different responses to variations in experimental conditions, making normalization a very demanding task. RESULTS: With the aim to remove unwanted systematic variation, we present an approach that utilizes variability information from multiple internal standard compounds to find optimal normalization factor for each individual molecular species detected by metabolomics approach (NOMIS). We demonstrate the method on mouse liver lipidomic profiles using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, and compare its performance to two commonly utilized normalization methods: normalization by l2 norm and by retention time region specific standard compound profiles. The NOMIS method proved superior in its ability to reduce the effect of systematic error across the full spectrum of metabolite peaks. We also demonstrate that the method can be used to select best combinations of standard compounds for normalization. CONCLUSION: Depending on experiment design and biological matrix, the NOMIS method is applicable either as a one-step normalization method or as a two-step method where the normalization parameters, influenced by variabilities of internal standard compounds and their correlation to metabolites, are first calculated from a study conducted in repeatability conditions. The method can also be used in analytical development of metabolomics methods by helping to select best combinations of standard compounds for a particular biological matrix and analytical platform.},

Among these associations, protein\textendash protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

The ncRNAs are recognized as important elements that play fundamental roles in the structural organization and function of plant genomes. Despite various hypotheses, TEs are believed to be a major precursor of ncRNAs. Transposable elements are also prime factors that cause genomic variation among members of a species. Hence, TEs pose a major challenge in the discovery and analysis of ncRNAs. With the increase in the number of sequenced plant genomes, it is now accepted that a single reference genome is insufficient to represent the complete genomic diversity and contents of a species, and exploring the pan-genome of a species is critical. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the field of plant pan-genomes. We also discuss TEs and their roles in ncRNA biogenesis and present our perspectives on the application of pan-genomes for the discovery of ncRNAs to fully explore and exploit their biological roles in plants.},

  abstract = {Although biochemists and geneticists have studied the cotton flower for more than one century, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the dramatic color change that occurs during its short developmental life following blooming. Through the analysis of world cotton germplasms, we found that all of the flowers underwent color changes post-anthesis, but there is a diverse array of petal colors among cotton species, with cream, yellow and red colors dominating the color scheme. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicated that both the original cream and red colors and the color changes post-anthesis were related to flavonoid content. The anthocyanin content and the expression of biosynthesis genes were both increased from blooming to one day post-anthesis (DPA) when the flower was withering and undergoing abscission. Our results indicated that the color changes and flavonoid biosynthesis of cotton flowers were precisely controlled and genetically regulated. In addition, flavonol synthase (FLS) genes involved in flavonol biosynthesis showed specific expression at 11 am when the flowers were fully opened. The anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) genes, which are responsible for proanthocyanidins biosynthesis, showed the highest expression at 6 pm on 0 DPA, when the flowers were withered. Light showed primary, moderate and little effects on flavonol, anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, respectively. Flavonol biosynthesis was in response to light exposure, while anthocyanin biosynthesis was involved in flower color changes. Further expression analysis of flavonoid genes in flowers of wild type and a flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) silenced line showed that the development of cotton flower color was controlled by a complex interaction between genes and light. These results present novel information regarding flavonoids metabolism and flower development.},

Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of factors such as sugar metabolism, the cytoskeleton, and hormones, which are commonly known to be involved in plant cell development, while the secondary metabolites have been less regarded. By mining public data and comparing analyses of fiber from two cotton species (Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), we found that the flavonoid metabolism is active in early fiber cell development. Different flavonoids exhibited distinct effects on fiber development during ovule culture; among them, naringenin (NAR) could significantly retard fiber development. NAR is a substrate of flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), and silencing the F3H gene significantly increased the NAR content of fiber cells. Fiber development was suppressed following F3H silencing, but the overexpression of F3H caused no obvious effects. Significant retardation of fiber growth was observed after the introduction of the F3H-RNA interference segment into the high-flavonoid brown fiber G. hirsutum T586 line by cross. A greater accumulation of NAR as well as much shorter fibers were also observed in the BC1 generation plants. These results suggest that NAR is negatively associated with fiber development and that the metabolism mediated by F3H is important in fiber development, thus highlighting that flavonoid metabolism represents a novel pathway with the potential for cotton fiber improvement.},

Advances in diploid hybrid breeding based on true seeds have the potential to revolutionize future potato breeding and production1\textendash 4. So far, relatively few studies have examined the genome evolution and diversity of wild and cultivated landrace potatoes, which limits the application of their diversity in potato breeding. Here we assemble 44 high-quality diploid potato genomes from 24 wild and 20 cultivated accessions that are representative of Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade, as well as 2 genomes from the neighbouring section, Etuberosum. Extensive discordance of phylogenomic relationships suggests the complexity of potato evolution. We find that the potato genome substantially expanded its repertoire of disease-resistance genes when compared with closely related seed-propagated solanaceous crops, indicative of the effect of tuber-based propagation strategies on the evolution of the potato genome. We discover a transcription factor that determines tuber identity and interacts with the mobile tuberization inductive signal SP6A. We also identify 561,433 high-confidence structural variants and construct a map of large inversions, which provides insights for improving inbred lines and precluding potential linkage drag, as exemplified by a 5.8-Mb inversion that is associated with carotenoid content in tubers. This study will accelerate hybrid potato breeding and enrich our understanding of the evolution and biology of potato as a global staple food crop.},

Enhancing the production of secondary metabolites is possible through the application of modern biotechnological techniques such as culturing hairy roots. In the present study, different strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes (ATCC11325, ATCC15834, A4, A7, A13, and K599) were used for hairy root induction from fenugreek cotyledon explants. Then, the effect of various levels (x, 2x, and 4x concentrations of B5 medium) of iron oxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles were evaluated on growth, total phenolic, flavonoids, and trigonelline content of hairy roots. The growth curve analysis revealed an increase in the fresh and dry weight of treated hairy roots, as compared with the control. The highest levels of fresh (1.49 g) and dry weight (1.23 g) were obtained in hairy roots which were induced by the ATCC11325 strain and were treated with Zn (2x). The results indicated that using Zn nanoparticles on hairy roots can lead to higher levels of trigonelline, compared with the control group (i.e. transformed hairy roots without NPs).},

Flavonoids are the main medicinal components in sweet tea and have significant pharmacological activities. Therefore, the quality of sweet tea is related to the content of flavonoids. Flavonoid content in plants is normally determined by time-consuming and expensive chemical analyses. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to measure three constituents of flavonoids, namely, total flavonoids, phloridin and trilobatin, in sweet tea leaves using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR). RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and NIR spectroscopy can distinguish sweet tea from different locations. In addition, different spectral preprocessing methods are used to establish partial least squares (PLS) models between spectral information and the content of the three constituents. The best total flavonoid prediction model was obtained with NIR spectra preprocessed with Savitzky-Golay combined with second derivatives (SG\,+\,D2) (RP2\,=\,0.893, and RMSEP\,=\,0.131). For trilobatin, the model with the best performance was developed with raw NIR spectra (RP2\,=\,0.902, and RMSEP\,=\,2.993), and for phloridin, the best model was obtained with NIR spectra preprocessed with standard normal variate (SNV) (RP2\,=\,0.818, and RMSEP\,=\,1.085). The coefficients of determination for all calibration sets, validation sets and prediction sets of the best PLS models were higher than 0.967, 0.858 and 0.818, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion indicated that NIR spectroscopy has the ability to determine the flavonoid content of sweet tea quickly and conveniently.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to understand how the addition of pectin (2.5\% and 5\%) affected the content and bioaccessibility of phenolics in red raspberry puree. The results showed that the concentration of antioxidants in red raspberry puree was reduced with the addition of pectin. Similarly, addition of pectin to red raspberry puree significantly reduced the total phenolic content (15\textendash 20\%), total antioxidant capacity (18\textendash 70\%), and total monomeric anthocyanin (25\textendash 30\%) after in vitro digestion. On the other hand, significant decreases in the bioaccessible amount of cyanidin (41\%), cyanidin-3-glucoside (14\%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (17\%), pelargonidin 3-glucoside (16\%), and peonidin (28\%) were observed after the addition of pectin (5\% (w/w)) compared to the control (p~{$<~$}0.05) as analyzed with the HPLC method. According to the LC-MS/MS analysis of red raspberry samples, five flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and phlorizin) and six phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid) were detected. The effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion varied depending on the type of the phenolic compounds. Sinapic acid and phlorizin were not detected at all in the intestinal phase, indicating that they were completely degraded during digestion. The percentage bioaccessibility of gallic acid (49\textendash 88\%), rutin (6\textendash 16\%), and quercetin (23\textendash 33\%) was decreased proportionally with the increase in the pectin content in red raspberry purees (p~{$<~$}0.05). On the other hand, only 5\% pectin addition to red raspberry puree resulted with a significant decrease in the amount of bioaccessible caffeic acid (8\% to 5\%), kaempferol (24\% to 13\%), ferulic acid (26\% to 10\%), and myricetin (91\% to 57\%) (p~{$<~$}0.05). Overall, the present study highlighted that incorporation of pectin to red raspberry puree reduced the amount of bioaccessible polyphenols.},

  abstract = {Cyclins are regulatory proteins that interact with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to control progression through the cell cycle. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 34 cyclin genes have been described, grouped into five different types (A, B, D, H, and T). A novel class of seven cyclins was isolated and characterized in Arabidopsis, designated P-type cyclins (CYCPs). They all share a conserved central region of 100 amino acids ("cyclin box") displaying homology to the corresponding region of the PHO80 cyclin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the related G1 cyclins from Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei. The CYCP4;2 gene was able to partially re-establish the phosphate-dependent expression of the PHO5 gene in a pho80 mutant strain of yeast. The CYCPs interact preferentially with CDKA;1 in vivo and in vitro as shown by yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. P-type cyclins were mostly expressed in proliferating cells, albeit also in differentiating and mature tissues. The possible role of CYCPs in linking cell division, cell differentiation, and the nutritional status of the cell is discussed.},

The strategy became increasingly popular for the simultaneous analysis of up to several hundred metabolites at high sensitivity, selectivity, and quantitative capability. However, the traditional method of assessing measured metabolomics data without probabilistic criteria is not only time-consuming but is often subjective and makeshift work. Our program overcomes these problems by detecting and identifying metabolites automatically, by separating isomeric metabolites, and by removing background noise using a probabilistic score defined as the odds ratio from an optimized multivariate logistic regression model. Our software program also provides a user-friendly graphical interface to curate and organize data matrices and to apply principal component analyses and statistical tests. For a demonstration, we conducted a widely targeted metabolome analysis (152 metabolites) of propagating Saccharomyces cerevisiae measured at 15 time points by gas and liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. MRMPROBS is a useful and practical tool for the assessment of large-scale MRM data available to any instrument or any experimental condition.},

  abstract = {Background: The morphogenesis of single-celled cotton fiber includes extreme elongation and staged cell wall differentiation. Designing strategies for improving cotton fiber for textiles and other uses relies on uncovering the related regulatory mechanisms. In this research we compared the transcriptomes and metabolomes of two Gossypium genotypes, Gossypium barbadense cv Phytogen 800 and G. hirsutum cv Deltapine 90. When grown in parallel, the two types of fiber developed similarly except for prolonged fiber elongation in the G. barbadense cultivar. The data were collected from isolated fibers between 10 to 28 days post anthesis (DPA) representing: primary wall synthesis to support elongation; transitional cell wall remodeling; and secondary wall cellulose synthesis, which was accompanied by continuing elongation only in G. barbadense fiber. Results: Of 206 identified fiber metabolites, 205 were held in common between the two genotypes. Approximately 38,000 transcripts were expressed in the fiber of each genotype, and these were mapped to the reference set and interpreted by homology to known genes. The developmental changes in the transcriptomes and the metabolomes were compared within and across genotypes with several novel implications. Transitional cell wall remodeling is a distinct stable developmental stage lasting at least four days (18 to 21 DPA). Expression of selected cell wall related transcripts was similar between genotypes, but cellulose synthase gene expression patterns were more complex than expected. Lignification was transcriptionally repressed in both genotypes. Oxidative stress was lower in the fiber of G. barbadense cv Phytogen 800 as compared to G. hirsutum cv Deltapine 90. Correspondingly, the G. barbadense cultivar had enhanced capacity for management of reactive oxygen species during its prolonged elongation period, as indicated by a 138-fold increase in ascorbate concentration at 28 DPA. Conclusions: The parallel data on deep-sequencing transcriptomics and non-targeted metabolomics for two genotypes of single-celled cotton fiber showed that a discrete developmental stage of transitional cell wall remodeling occurs before secondary wall cellulose synthesis begins. The data showed how lignification can be transcriptionally repressed during secondary cell wall synthesis, and they implicated enhanced capacity to manage reactive oxygen species through the ascorbate-glutathione cycle as a positive contributor to fiber length.},

  abstract = {AIM: To characterize the urinary metabolomic fingerprint and multi-metabolite signature associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and to classify the population into metabotypes related to T2D. METHODS: A metabolomics analysis using the 1H-NMR-based, non-targeted metabolomic approach was conducted to determine the urinary metabolomic fingerprint of T2D compared with non-T2D participants in the PREDIMED trial. The discriminant metabolite fingerprint was subjected to logistic regression analysis and ROC analyses to establish and to assess the multi-metabolite signature of T2D prevalence, respectively. Metabotypes associated with T2D were identified using the k-means algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 33 metabolites were significantly different (P{$<$}0.05) between T2D and non-T2D participants. The multi-metabolite signature of T2D comprised high levels of methylsuccinate, alanine, dimethylglycine and guanidoacetate, and reduced levels of glutamine, methylguanidine, 3-hydroxymandelate and hippurate, and had a 96.4\% AUC, which was higher than the metabolites on their own and glucose. Amino-acid and carbohydrate metabolism were the main metabolic alterations in T2D, and various metabotypes were identified in the studied population. Among T2D participants, those with a metabotype of higher levels of phenylalanine, phenylacetylglutamine, p-cresol and acetoacetate had significantly higher levels of plasma glucose. CONCLUSION: The multi-metabolite signature of T2D highlights the altered metabolic fingerprint associated mainly with amino-acid, carbohydrate and microbiota metabolism. Metabotypes identified in this patient population could be related to higher risk of long-term cardiovascular events and therefore require further studies. Metabolomics is a useful tool for elucidating the metabolic complexity and interindividual variation in T2D towards the development of stratified precision nutrition and medicine.

Proteome datasets display high technical variability and frequent missing values. Sophisticated strategies for batch effect reduction are lacking or rely on error-prone data imputation. Here we introduce HarmonizR, a data harmonization tool with appropriate missing value handling. The method exploits the structure of available data and matrix dissection for minimal data loss, without data imputation. This strategy implements two common batch effect reduction methods\textemdash ComBat and limma (removeBatchEffect()). The HarmonizR strategy, evaluated on four exemplarily analyzed datasets with up to 23 batches, demonstrated successful data harmonization for different tissue preservation techniques, LC-MS/MS instrumentation setups, and quantification approaches. Compared to data imputation methods, HarmonizR was more efficient and performed superior regarding the detection of significant proteins. HarmonizR is an efficient tool for missing data tolerant experimental variance reduction and is easily adjustable for individual dataset properties and user preferences.},

  abstract = {Macroorganisms' genotypes shape their phenotypes, which in turn shape the habitat available to potential microbial symbionts. This influence of host genotype on microbiome composition has been demonstrated in many systems; however, most previous studies have either compared unrelated genotypes or delved into molecular mechanisms. As a result, it is currently unclear whether the heritability of host-associated microbiomes follows similar patterns to the heritability of other complex traits. We take a new approach to this question by comparing the microbiomes of diverse maize inbred lines and their F1 hybrid offspring, which we quantified in both rhizosphere and leaves of field-grown plants using 16S-v4 and ITS1 amplicon sequencing. We show that inbred lines and hybrids differ consistently in the composition of bacterial and fungal rhizosphere communities, as well as leaf-associated fungal communities. A wide range of microbiome features display heterosis within individual crosses, consistent with patterns for nonmicrobial maize phenotypes. For leaf microbiomes, these results were supported by the observation that broad-sense heritability in hybrids was substantially higher than narrow-sense heritability. Our results support our hypothesis that at least some heterotic host traits affect microbiome composition in maize.},

  abstract = {Gossypium hirsutum L. (cotton) fibres are specialized trichomes a few centimetres in length that grow from the seed coat. Few genes directly involved in the differentiation of these epidermal cells have been identified. These include GhMYB25-like and GhMYB25, two related MYB transcription factors that regulate fibre cell initiation and expansion. We have also identified a putative homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factor, GhHD-1, expressed in trichomes and early fibres that might play a role in cotton fibre initiation. Here, we characterize GhHD-1 homoeologues from tetraploid G. hirsutum and show, using reporter constructs and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), that they are expressed predominantly in epidermal tissues during early fibre development, and in other tissues bearing epidermal trichomes. Silencing of GhHD-1 reduced trichome formation and delayed the timing of fibre initiation. Constitutive overexpression of GhHD-1 increased the number of fibres initiating on the seed, but did not affect leaf trichomes. Expression of GhHD-1 in cotton silenced for different fibre MYBs suggest that in ovules it acts downstream of GhMYB25-like, but is unaffected in GhMYB25- or GhMYB109-silenced plants. Microarray analysis of silencing and overexpression lines of GhHD-1 indicated that it potentially regulates the levels of ethylene and reactive oxidation species (ROS) through a WRKY transcription factor and calcium-signalling pathway genes to activate downstream genes necessary for cell expansion and elongation.},

Our package takes the output of any general enrichment analysis and generates plots at different levels of detail: from a general overview to identify the most enriched categories (bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed view displaying different types of information for molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot). The package provides a deeper insight into omics data and allows scientists to generate insightful plots with only a few lines of code to easily communicate the findings. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package GOplot is available via CRAN-The Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GOplot.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are known to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Photo-thermosensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) is a very important germplasm resource in two-line hybrid rice breeding. Although many circRNAs have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.), little is known about the biological roles of circRNAs in the fertility transition of the PTGMS rice line. RESULTS: In the present study, RNA-sequencing libraries were constructed from the young panicles of the Wuxiang S sterile line rice (WXS (S)) and its fertile line rice (WXS (F)) at three development stages with three biological replicates. A total of 9994 circRNAs were obtained in WXS rice based on high-throughput strand-specific RNA sequencing and bioinformatic approaches, of which 5305 were known circRNAs and 4689 were novel in rice. And 14 of 16 randomly selected circRNAs were experimentally validated with divergent primers. Our results showed that 186 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in WXS (F) compared with WXS (S), of which 97, 87 and 60 circRNAs were differentially expressed at the pollen mother cell (PMC) formation stage (P2), the meiosis stage (P3) and the microspore formation stage (P4), respectively. Fertility specific expression patterns of eight circRNAs were analysis by qRT-PCR. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis of the parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) revealed that they mainly participated in various biological processes such as development, response to stimulation, hormonal regulation, and reproduction. Furthermore, 15 DECs were found to act as putative miRNA sponges to involved in fertility transition in PTGMS rice line. CONCLUSION: In the present study, the abundance and characteristics of circRNAs were investigated in the PTGMS rice line using bioinformatic approaches. Moreover, the expression patterns of circRNAs were different between WXS (F) and WXS (S). Our findings primarily revealed that circRNAs might be endogenous noncoding regulators of flower and pollen development, and were involved in the fertility transition in the PTGMS rice line, and guide the production and application of two-line hybrid rice.},

Here, we characterized the cellular functions of the class I TCP transcription factor GhTCP14 from upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). GhTCP14 is expressed predominantly in fiber cells, especially at the initiation and elongation stages of development, and its expression increased in response to exogenous auxin. Induced heterologous overexpression of GhTCP14 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) enhanced initiation and elongation of trichomes and root hairs. In addition, root gravitropism was severely affected, similar to mutant of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED2 (PIN2) gene. Examination of auxin distribution in GhTCP14-expressing Arabidopsis by observation of auxin-responsive reporters revealed substantial alterations in auxin distribution in sepal trichomes and root cortical regions. Consistent with these changes, expression of the auxin uptake carrier AUXIN1 (AUX1) was up-regulated and PIN2 expression was down-regulated in the GhTCP14-expressing plants. The association of GhTCP14 with auxin responses was also evidenced by the enhanced expression of auxin response gene IAA3, a gene in the AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) family. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that GhTCP14 bound the promoters of PIN2, IAA3, and AUX1, and transactivation assays indicated that GhTCP14 had transcription activation activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GhTCP14 is a dual-function transcription factor able to positively or negatively regulate expression of auxin response and transporter genes, thus potentially acting as a crucial regulator in auxin-mediated differentiation and elongation of cotton fiber cells.},

Herein, we identified a total of 226 full-length F-box genes in pear for the first time. And these genes were further divided into various subgroups based on specific domains and phylogenetic analysis. Intriguingly, we observed that whole-genome duplication and dispersed duplication have a major contribution to F-box family expansion. Furthermore, the dynamic evolution for different modes of gene duplication was dissected. Interestingly, we found that dispersed and tandem duplicate have been evolving at a high rate. In addition, we found that F-box genes exhibited functional specificity based on GO analysis, and most of the F-box genes were significantly enriched in the protein binding (GO: 0005515) term, supporting that F-box genes might play a critical role for gene regulation in pear. Transcriptome and digital expression profiles revealed that F-box genes are involved in the development of multiple pear tissues. Overall, these results will set stage for elaborating the biological role of F-box genes in pear and other plants.},

Growing shoots of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) represent an excellent model of fast growth and their circular RNAs have not been studied yet. To understand the potential regulation of circular RNAs, we systematically characterized circular RNAs from eight different developmental stages of rapidly growing shoots. Here, we identified 895 circular RNAs including a subset of mutually inclusive circRNA. These circular RNAs were generated from 759 corresponding parental coding genes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin biosynthetic process. Gene co-expression analysis revealed that hub genes, such as DEFECTIVE IN RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 1 (DRD1), MAINTENANCE OF METHYLATION (MOM), dicer-like 3 (DCL3) and ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1), were significantly enriched giving rise to circular RNAs. The expression level of these circular RNAs presented correlation with its linear counterpart according to transcriptome sequencing. Further protoplast transformation experiments indicated that overexpressing circ-bHLH93 generating from transcription factor decreased its linear transcript. Finally, the expression profiles suggested that circular RNAs may have interplay with miRNAs to regulate their cognate linear mRNAs, which was further supported by overexpressing miRNA156 decreasing the transcript of circ-TRF-1 and linear transcripts of TRF-1. Taken together, the overall profile of circular RNAs provided new insight into an unexplored category of long noncoding RNA regulation in moso bamboo.},

  abstract = {Circular RNA (CircRNA) is a type of single-stranded RNA that plays a vital role in gene regulation during and after transcription. However, the functional role of circRNA in polyploid crop hybridization has not yet been reported. In this study, a high-yield elite upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) inbred line, 4133Bt, crossed with a high-quality elite inbred line, J02\textendash 247, produced a high -yield and high-quality F1 hybrid. An RNA-sequence library was constructed from three biological replicates of the parents and F1 hybrids in the vegetative and reproductive growth periods. A total of 340 high-confidence circRNAs were identified. Our results showed that the circRNAs were more active in ovules than in fiber and leaves and that the host genes of ovule-specific circRNAs were involved in nucleoside metabolic processes. In addition, single parent expressed (SPE) circRNAs and extremely nonadditively expressed (ENAE) circRNAs had different expression patterns in the F1 hybrid. Moreover, 32 out of the 340 circRNAs were found to be dominant (expression level dominance, ELD) or overdominant (transgressive) at the expression level. These circRNAs might regulate the expression of their host genes through competitive inhibition. Eight of these 32 circRNAs might regulate gene expression through a putative ceRNA network. At 0 days post-anthesis (0 DPA) ovule, five circRNAs were found to interact with six miRNAs that are associated with the regulation of cytoskeleton- and plant cell wall-related genes during the initiation stage of cotton fiber development. Two circRNAs that interacted with two miRNAs to regulate vesicle transport and signal transduction pathways during the fiber elongation stage were identified at 10 DPA (fiber). These results indicate that circRNA may regulate the initiation and elongation stages of cotton fiber via a sponge model during the hybridization process. This study provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of hybrid breeding from a new perspective.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of newly identified non-coding RNAs through high-throughput deep sequencing, which play important roles in miRNA function and transcriptional controlling in human, animals and plants. To date, there is no report in wheat seedlings regarding the circRNAs identification and roles in the dehydration stress response. In present study, the total RNA was extracted from leaves of wheat seedlings under dehydration-stressed and well-watered conditions, respectively. Then, the circRNAs enriched library based deep sequencing was performed and the circRNAs were identified using bioinformatics tools. Around 88 circRNAs candidates were isolated in wheat seedlings leaves while 62 were differentially expressed in dehydration-stressed seedlings compared to well-watered control. Among the dehydration responsive circRNAs, six were found to act as 26 corresponding miRNAs sponges in wheat. Sixteen circRNAs including the 6 miRNAs sponges and other 10 randomly selected ones were further validated to be circular by real-time PCR assay, and 14 displayed consistent regulation patterns with the transcriptome sequencing results. After Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the targeted mRNAs functions, the circRNAs were predicted to be involved in dehydration responsive process, such as photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, as well as plant hormone signal transduction, involving auxin, brassinosteroid, and salicylic acid. Herein, we revealed a possible connection between the regulations of circRNAs with the expressions of functional genes in wheat leaves associated with dehydration resistance.},

However, the systematic identification of circRNAs in plants, especially non-model plants, is limited. In addition, raw report on the prediction of the potential role of circRNAs in plant response to pathogen invasion is currently available. We conducted the systematic identification of circRNAs from four materials originating from three species belonging to genus Actinidia under different situations using ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depleted RNA-Seq data. A total of 3,582 circRNAs were identified in Actinidia, of which 64.01\%, 21.44\%, and 14.55\% were intergenic circRNAs, exonic circRNAs, and intronic circRNAs, respectively. Tissue-specific expression of circRNAs was observed in kiwifruit, and a species-specific response was detected when infected with Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), which is the causative agent of kiwifruit bacterial canker disease. Furthermore, we found that both exonic and intronic circRNAs were significantly positively correlated to parent protein-coding genes, and intronic circRNAs are a class of highly remarkable regulators the parent genes comparing to that of exonic circRNAs. Expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified a set of circRNAs that were closely associated with plant defence response. The findings of the presents study suggest that circRNAs exhibit tissue- and species-specific expression, as well as play an important role in plant immune response.},

  abstract = {Tea is an important economic crop with a 3.02 Gb genome. It accumulates various bioactive compounds, especially catechins, which are closely associated with tea flavor and quality. Catechins are biosynthesized through the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways, with 12 structural genes being involved in their synthesis. However, we found that in Camellia sinensis the understanding of the basic profile of catechins biosynthesis is still unclear. The gene structure, locus, transcript number, transcriptional variation, and function of multigene families have not yet been clarified. Our previous studies demonstrated that the accumulation of flavonoids in tea is species, tissue, and induction specific, which indicates that gene coexpression patterns may be involved in tea catechins and flavonoids biosynthesis. In this paper, we screened candidate genes of multigene families involved in the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways based on an analysis of genome and transcriptome sequence data. The authenticity of candidate genes was verified by PCR cloning, and their function was validated by reverse genetic methods. In the present study, 36 genes from 12 gene families were identified and were accessed in the NCBI database. During this process, some intron retention events of the CsCHI and CsDFR genes were found. Furthermore, the transcriptome sequencing of various tea tissues and subcellular location assays revealed coexpression and colocalization patterns. The correlation analysis showed that CsCHIc, CsF3{${'}$}H, and CsANRb expression levels are associated significantly with the concentration of soluble PA as well as the expression levels of CsPALc and CsPALf with the concentration of insoluble PA. This work provides insights into catechins metabolism in tea and provides a foundation for future studies.},

Using this dataset, we constructed complex regulatory networks allowing to identify key structural genes and transcription factors that regulate the metabolism of soluble sugars, organic acids and important volatiles in kiwifruit. Moreover, our study revealed the regulatory mechanism involving key transcription factors regulating flavor metabolism. The modulation of flavor metabolism by the identified key transcription factors was confirmed in different kiwifruit species providing the proof of concept that our dataset provides a suitable tool for clarification of the regulatory factors controlling flavor biosynthetic pathways that have not been previously illuminated. Overall, in addition to providing new insight into the metabolic regulation of flavor during fruit development and ripening, the outcome of our study establishes a foundation for flavor improvement in kiwifruit.},

Foxtail millet is also tolerance to various abiotic stresses, including drought, making it a good plant for growing in barren land. The study on the composition of metabolites and its dynamics changes during grain development is helpful to understand the process of foxtail millet grain formation. In our study, metabolic and transcriptional analysis were used to uncover the metabolic processes that could influence grain filling in foxtail millet. A total of 2104 known metabolites, belonging to 14 categories, were identified during grain filling. Functional analysis of DAMs and DEGs revealed a stage-specific metabolic properties in foxtail millet grain filling. Some important metabolic processes, such as flavonoid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis were co-mapped for DEGs and DAMs. Thus, we constructed a gene-metabolite regulatory network of these metabolic pathways to explain their potential functions during grain filling. Our study showed the important metabolic processes during grain filling and focused on the dynamic changes of related metabolites and genes at different stages, which provided a reference for us to better understand and improve foxtail millet grain development and yield.},

However, the PSP biosynthetic pathway is largely unknown. Understanding the genetic background will help delineate that pathway at the molecular level so that researchers can develop better conservation strategies. After comparing the PSP contents among several different P. sibiricum germplasms, we selected two groups with the largest contrasts in contents and subjected them to HiSeq2500 transcriptome sequencing to identify the candidate genes involved in PSP biosynthesis. In all, 20 kinds of enzyme-encoding genes were related to PSP biosynthesis. The polysaccharide content was positively correlated with the expression patterns of {$\beta$}-fructofuranosidase (sacA), fructokinase (scrK), UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (GALE), Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (GMPP), and UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH), but negatively correlated with the expression of Hexokinase (HK). Through qRT-PCR validation and comprehensive analysis, we determined that sacA, HK, and GMPP are key genes for enzymes within the PSP metabolic pathway in P. sibiricum. Our results provide a public transcriptome dataset for this species and an outline of pathways for the production of polysaccharides in medicinal plants. They also present more information about the PSP biosynthesis pathway at the molecular level in P. sibiricum and lay the foundation for subsequent research of gene functions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long Noncoding-RNAs (LncRNAs) are known to be involved in some biological processes, but their roles in plant-virus interactions remain largely unexplored. While circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been studied in animals, there has yet to be extensive research on them in a plant system, especially in tomato-tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) interaction. RESULTS: In this study, RNA transcripts from the susceptible tomato line JS-CT-9210 either infected with TYLCV or untreated, were sequenced in a pair-end strand-specific manner using ribo-zero rRNA removal library method. A total of 2056 lncRNAs including 1767 long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNAs) and 289 long non-coding natural antisense transcripts (lncNATs) were obtained. The expression patterns in lncRNAs were similar in susceptible tomato plants between control check (CK) and TYLCV infected samples. Our analysis suggested that lncRNAs likely played a role in a variety of functions, including plant hormone signaling, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, RNA transport, ribosome function, photosynthesis, glulathione metabolism, and plant-pathogen interactions. Using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis, we found that reduced expression of the lncRNA S-slylnc0957 resulted in enhanced resistance to TYLCV in susceptible tomato plants. Moreover, we identified 184 circRNAs candidates using the CircRNA Identifier (CIRI) software, of which 32 circRNAs were specifically expressed in untreated samples and 83 circRNAs in TYLCV samples. Approximately 62\% of these circRNAs~were derived from exons. We validated the circRNAs by both PCR and Sanger sequencing using divergent primers, and found that most of circRNAs were derived from the exons of protein coding genes. The silencing of these circRNAs parent genes resulted in decreased TYLCV virus accumulation. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified novel lncRNAs and circRNAs using bioinformatic approaches and showed that these RNAs function as negative regulators of TYLCV infection. Moreover, the expression patterns of lncRNAs in susceptible tomato plants were different from that of resistant tomato plants, while exonic circRNAs expression positively associated with their respective protein coding genes. This work provides a foundation for elaborating the novel roles of lncRNAs and circRNAs in susceptible tomatoes following TYLCV infection.},

  abstract = {Strigolactones (SLs), a class of the most recently identified terpenoid phytohormones, play essential roles in plant development, specifically in suppressing shoot branching. MAX2, a subunit of an SCF E3 ligase and a positive regulator that inhibits shoot branching, is likely a key SL signaling component. Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence to demonstrate that BES1 interacts with MAX2 and acts as its substrate to regulate SL-responsive gene expression. Additional AtD14, a putative receptor of SLs, can promote BES1 degradation. Knockdown of BES1 and its homologs dramatically suppressed the branching phenotype of max2-1 mutant. These results portray an SL signaling cascade from the putative receptor to downstream transcription factors. In addition, we demonstrate that the SL and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathways distinctly regulate the same transcription factor, BES1, to control specific developmental processes.},

  abstract = {Circular RNA (circRNA) is a newly discovered non-coding RNA, which play significant roles in the function and transcriptional regulation of microRNA. To date, in Chinese cabbage, the functional characteristic of circRNAs in response to calcium deficiency-induced tip-burn have not been reported. In this study, 730 circRNAs were isolated from Chinese cabbage leaves, of which 23 and 22 were differentially expressed in different calcium deficiency stages compared with the control. Forty-six host genes of the differentially expressed circRNAs were identified, and one circRNA was found to act as miRNAs sponges. Based on the functional analysis of host genes and target mRNAs of the corresponding miRNAs, the identified circRNAs might participated in response to stimulus, electron carrier activity, ATPase activity, cell wall metabolism, transcription factors and plant hormone signal transduction. ABF2, a positive regulator of the abiotic stress response in the abscisic acid (ABA) pathway, may play a role in calcium deficiency tolerance through a circRNA regulatory pathway. Correspondingly, the concentration of ABA is also increased during the Ca2+ deficiency stress. Our results suggest that circRNAs participate in a broad range of biological processes and physiological functions in the response to calcium deficiency-induced tip-burn and provide a basis for further studies of the biological roles that circRNAs play in the plant stress response.},

  abstract = {A main challenge in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is to pinpoint possible causal variants. Results from GWAS typically do not directly translate into causal variants because the majority of hits are in non-coding or intergenic regions, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium leads to effects being statistically spread out across multiple variants. Post-GWAS annotation facilitates the selection of most likely causal variant(s). Multiple resources are available for post-GWAS annotation, yet these can be time consuming and do not provide integrated visual aids for data interpretation. We, therefore, develop FUMA: an integrative web-based platform using information from multiple biological resources to facilitate functional annotation of GWAS results, gene prioritization and interactive visualization. FUMA accommodates positional, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin interaction mappings, and provides gene-based, pathway and tissue enrichment results. FUMA results directly aid in generating hypotheses that are testable in functional experiments aimed at proving causal relations.},

  abstract = {Strawberries were sprayed with 1.4\,mL L-1 of tea tree oil (TTO) 6, 3, and 0 d before harvest to investigate the effects of preharvest TTO treatment on fruit quality parameters. The results showed that TTO treatment reduces the incidence of natural decay and delays the loss of firmness during storage at 20\,\textdegree C for 5 d. TTO treatment has no effect on total soluble solids content or titratable acidity. Preharvest treatment with TTO reduces the number of microorganisms on the surface of fruit at harvest, reduces H2O2 accumulation by increasing the activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, and increases {$\beta$}-1,3-glucanase activity by the first day postharvest. Treated fruits also accumulate more phenolics as a result of increased phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. A total of 188 differentially expressed proteins were identified by comparing untreated and TTO-treated fruit using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Of these, 29 were more abundant and 159 were less abundant in TTO-treated fruit. Three proteins related to cell wall metabolism were down-regulated by TTO treatment, while 4 proteins involved in stress response were up-regulated. Therefore, TTO treatment prior to harvest effectively controls postharvest decay in strawberries by reducing microorganisms at harvest, delaying fruit senescence, and inducing defense responses.},

The genetic complexity of the fiber transcriptome is very high and accounts for as much as 45\textendash 50\% of the genes in the cotton genome. In addition to a large diverse group of constitutively expressed genes, expression profiling of the transcriptome revealed two developmentally regulated stage-specific expression patterns that define rapid cell elongation during primary cell wall (PCW) synthesis relative to secondary cell wall biogenesis. In developing cotton fibers, many fiber genes involved in PCW synthesis and turgor-driven cell expansion are differentially expressed in a manner that parallels the growth rate.

  abstract = {Summary: Metabolomic publications and databases use different database identifiers or even trivial names which disable queries across databases or between studies. The best way to annotate metabolites is by chemical structures, encoded by the International Chemical Identifier code (InChI) or InChIKey. We have implemented a web-based Chemical Translation Service that performs batch conversions of the most common compound identifiers, including CAS, CHEBI, compound formulas, Human Metabolome Database HMDB, InChI, InChIKey, IUPAC name, KEGG, LipidMaps, PubChem CID+SID, SMILES and chemical synonym names. Batch conversion downloads of 1410 CIDs are performed in 2.5 min. Structures are automatically displayed.Implementation: The software was implemented in Groovy and JAVA, the web frontend was implemented in GRAILS and the database used was PostgreSQL.Availability: The source code and an online web interface are freely available.

  abstract = {Central to plant microRNA (miRNA) biology is the identification of functional miRNA-target interactions (MTIs). However, the complementarity basis of bioinformatic target prediction results in mostly false positives, and the degree of complementarity does not equate with regulation. Here, we develop a bioinformatic workflow named TRUEE (Targets Ranked Using Experimental Evidence) that ranks MTIs on the extent to which they are subjected to miRNA-mediated cleavage. It sorts predicted targets into high (HE) and low evidence (LE) groupings based on the frequency and strength of miRNA-guided cleavage degradome signals across multiple degradome experiments. From this, each target is assigned a numerical value, termed a Category Score, ranking the extent to which it is subjected to miRNA-mediated cleavage. As a proof-of-concept, the 428 Arabidopsis miRNAs annotated in miRBase were processed through the TRUEE pipeline to determine the miRNA 'targetome'. The majority of high-ranking Category Score targets corresponded to highly conserved MTIs, validating the workflow. Very few Arabidopsis-specific, Brassicaceae-specific, or Conserved-passenger miRNAs had HE targets with high Category Scores. In total, only several hundred MTIs were found to have Category Scores characteristic of currently known physiologically significance MTIs. Although non-exhaustive, clearly the number of functional MTIs is much narrower than many studies claim. Therefore, using TRUEE to numerically rank targets \,directly on experimental evidence has given insights into the scope of the functional miRNA targetome of Arabidopsis.},

The broad application of high-throughput sequencing technology has made routinely generation of bulk smRNA sequences in laboratories possible, thus has significantly increased the need for batch analysis tools. PsRobot is a web-based easy-to-use tool dedicated to the identification of smRNAs with stem-loop shaped precursors (such as microRNAs and short hairpin RNAs) and their target genes/transcripts. It performs fast analysis to identify smRNAs with stem-loop shaped precursors among batch input data and predicts their targets using a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm. PsRobot integrates the expression data of smRNAs in major plant smRNA biogenesis gene mutants and smRNA-associated protein complexes to give clues to the smRNA generation and functional processes. Besides improved specificity, the reliability of smRNA target prediction results can also be evaluated by mRNA cleavage (degradome) data. The cross species conservation statuses and the multiplicity of smRNA target sites are also provided. PsRobot is freely accessible at http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/psRobot/.},

Here, we combine bulk RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses, including weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA), to investigate the gene regulatory networks regulating hiPSC differentiation under chondrogenic conditions. We identify specific WNTs and MITF as hub genes governing the generation of off-target differentiation into neural cells and melanocytes during hiPSC chondrogenesis. With heterocellular signaling models, we further show that WNT signaling produced by off-target cells is~responsible for inducing chondrocyte hypertrophy. By targeting WNTs and MITF, we eliminate these cell lineages, significantly enhancing the yield and homogeneity of hiPSC-derived chondrocytes. Collectively, our findings identify the trajectories and molecular mechanisms governing cell fate decision in hiPSC chondrogenesis, as well as dynamic transcriptome profiles orchestrating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.},

A recent study showed that circRNAs exist in plants and play a role in their environmental stress responses. However, cotton circRNAs and their role in Verticillium wilt response have not been identified up to now. In this study, two CSSLs (chromosome segment substitution lines) of G.barbadense introgressed into G. hirsutum, CSSL-1 and CSSL-4 (a resistant line and a susceptible line to Verticillium wilt, respectively), were inoculated with V. dahliae for RNA-seq library construction and circRNA analysis. A total of 686 novel circRNAs were identified. CSSL-1 and CSSL-4 had similar numbers of circRNAs and shared many circRNAs in common. However, CSSL-4 differentially expressed approximately twice as many circRNAs as CSSL-1, and the differential expression levels of the common circRNAs were generally higher in CSSL-1 than in CSSL-4. Moreover, two C-RRI comparisons, C-RRI-vs-C-RRM and C-RRI-vs-C-RSI, possessed a large proportion (approximately 50\%) of the commonly and differentially expressed circRNAs. These results indicate that the differentially expressed circRNAs may play roles in the Verticillium wilt response in cotton. A total of 280 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified. A Gene Ontology analysis showed that most of the 'stimulus response' term source genes were NBS family genes, of which most were the source genes from the differentially expressed circRNAs, indicating that NBS genes may play a role in Verticillium wilt resistance and might be regulated by circRNAs in the disease-resistance process in cotton.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In maize hybrid breeding, complementary pools of parental lines with reshuffled genetic variants are established for superior hybrid performance. To comprehensively decipher the genetics of heterosis, we present a new design of multiple linked F1 populations with 42,840 F1 maize hybrids, generated by crossing a synthetic population of 1428 maternal lines with 30 elite testers from diverse genetic backgrounds and phenotyped for agronomic traits. RESULTS: We show that, although yield heterosis is correlated with the widespread, minor-effect epistatic QTLs, it may be resulted from a few major-effect additive and dominant QTLs in early developmental stages. Floral transition is probably one critical stage for heterosis formation, in which epistatic QTLs are activated by paternal contributions of alleles that counteract the recessive, deleterious maternal alleles. These deleterious alleles, while rare, epistatically repress other favorable QTLs. We demonstrate this with one example, showing that Brachytic2 represses the Ubiquitin3 locus in the maternal lines; in hybrids, the paternal allele alleviates this repression, which in turn recovers the height of the plant and enhances the weight of the ear. Finally, we propose a molecular design breeding by manipulating key genes underlying the transition from vegetative-to-reproductive growth. CONCLUSION: The new population design is used to dissect the genetic basis of heterosis which accelerates maize molecular design breeding by diminishing deleterious epistatic interactions.},

  abstract = {Cotton is the main source of renewable fiber in the world and is primarily used for textile production. Cotton fibers are single cells differentiated from the ovule epidermis and are an excellent model system for studying cell elongation, polyploidization and cell wall biosynthesis. Plant hormones, which are present in relatively low concentrations, play important roles in various developmental processes, and recently, multiple reports have revealed the pivotal roles of hormones in regulating cotton fiber development. For example, exogenous application of hormones has been shown to promote the initiation and growth of fiber cells. However, a comprehensive understanding about phytohormone regulating fiber development is still unknown. Here, we focus on recent advances in elucidating the roles of multiple phytohormones in the control of fiber development, namely auxin, gibberellin, brassinosteroid, ethylene, cytokinin, abscisic acid and strigolactones. We not only review the identification of genes involved in hormone biosynthetic and signaling pathways, but also discuss the mechanisms of these phytohormones in regulating the initiation and elongation of fiber cells in cotton. Auxin, gibberellin, brassinosteroid, ethylene, jasmonic acid and strigolactones play positive roles in fiber development, whereas cytokinin and abscisic acid inhibit fiber growth. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive review of the role of phytohormones in cotton fiber development that will serve as the basis for further elucidation of the mechanisms by which plant hormones regulate fiber growth.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be differentially expressed during cotton fibre development. However, which specific miRNAs and how they are involved in fibre development is unclear. Here, using deep sequencing, 65 conserved miRNA families were identified and 32 families were differentially expressed between leaf and ovule. At least 40 miRNAs were either leaf or ovule specific, whereas 62 miRNAs were shared in both leaf and ovule. qRT-PCR confirmed these miRNAs were differentially expressed during fibre early development. A total of 820 genes were potentially targeted by the identified miRNAs, whose functions are involved in a series of biological processes including fibre development, metabolism and signal transduction. Many predicted miRNA-target pairs were subsequently validated by degradome sequencing analysis. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the identified miRNAs and their targets were classified to 1027 GO terms including 568 biological processes, 324 molecular functions and 135 cellular components and were enriched to 78 KEGG pathways. At least seven unique miRNAs participate in trichome regulatory interaction network. Eleven trans-acting siRNA (tasiRNA) candidate genes were also identified in cotton. One has never been found in other plant species and two of them were derived from MYB and ARF, both of which play important roles in cotton fibre development. Sixteen genes were predicted to be tasiRNA targets, including sucrose synthase and MYB2. Together, this study discovered new miRNAs in cotton and offered evidences that miRNAs play important roles in cotton ovule/fibre development. The identification of tasiRNA genes and their targets broadens our understanding of the complicated regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in cotton.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be differentially expressed during cotton fibre development. However, which specific miRNAs and how they are involved in fibre development is unclear. Here, using deep sequencing, 65 conserved miRNA families were identified and 32 families were differentially expressed between leaf and ovule. At least 40 miRNAs were either leaf or ovule specific, whereas 62 miRNAs were shared in both leaf and ovule. qRT-PCR confirmed these miRNAs were differentially expressed during fibre early development. A total of 820 genes were potentially targeted by the identified miRNAs, whose functions are involved in a series of biological processes including fibre development, metabolism and signal transduction. Many predicted miRNA-target pairs were subsequently validated by degradome sequencing analysis. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the identified miRNAs and their targets were classified to 1027 GO terms including 568 biological processes, 324 molecular functions and 135 cellular components and were enriched to 78 KEGG pathways. At least seven unique miRNAs participate in trichome regulatory interaction network. Eleven trans-acting siRNA (tasiRNA) candidate genes were also identified in cotton. One has never been found in other plant species and two of them were derived from MYB and ARF, both of which play important roles in cotton fibre development. Sixteen genes were predicted to be tasiRNA targets, including sucrose synthase and MYB2. Together, this study discovered new miRNAs in cotton and offered evidences that miRNAs play important roles in cotton ovule/fibre development. The identification of tasiRNA genes and their targets broadens our understanding of the complicated regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in cotton.},

  abstract = {Flavonols are health-promoting bioactive compounds important for plant defense and human nutrition. Quercetin (Q) and kaempferol (K) biosynthesis have been studied extensively while little is known about myricetin (M) biosynthesis. The roles of flavonol synthases (FLSs) and flavonoid 3{${'}$},5{${'}$}-hydroxylase (F3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H) in M biosynthesis in Morella rubra, a member of the Myricaceae rich in M-based flavonols, were investigated. The level of MrFLS transcripts alone did not correlate well with the accumulation of M-based flavonols. However, combined transcript data for MrFLS1 and MrF3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H showed a good correlation with the accumulation of M-based flavonols in different tissues of M. rubra. Recombinant MrFLS1 and MrFLS2 proteins showed strong activity with dihydroquercetin (DHQ), dihydrokaempferol (DHK), and dihydromyricetin (DHM) as substrates, while recombinant MrF3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H protein preferred converting K to M, amongst a range of substrates. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) overexpressing 35S::MrFLSs produced elevated levels of K-based and Q-based flavonols without affecting M-based flavonol levels, while tobacco overexpressing 35S::MrF3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H accumulated significantly higher levels of M-based flavonols. We conclude that M accumulation in M. rubra is affected by gene expression and enzyme specificity of FLS and F3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H as well as substrate availability. In the metabolic grid of flavonol biosynthesis, the strong activity of MrF3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H with K as substrate additionally promotes metabolic flux towards M in M. rubra.},

  abstract = {Heterosis is characterized by higher seed yields, plant biomass or other traits in heterozygotes or hybrids compared with their genetically divergent parents, which are often homozygous. Despite extensive investigation of heterosis and its wide application in crops such as maize, rice, wheat and sorghum, its molecular basis is still enigmatic. In the past century, some pioneers have proposed multigene models referring to the complementation of allelic and gene expression variation, which is likely to be an important contributor to heterosis. In addition, there are potential interactions of epigenetic variation involved in heterosis via novel mechanisms. At the level of gene expression, many recent studies have revealed that the heterosis phenomenon can be deciphered not only at the transcriptional level but also at the proteomic level. This review presents an update on the information supporting the involvement of proteomic patterns in heterosis and a possible future direction of the field.

The blue pigment indigo has seen widespread usage across South America, Egypt, Europe, India and China for thousands of years, mainly extracted from indigo-rich plants. The utilization and genetic engineering of indigo in industries and ethnobotanical studies on the effects of cultural selection on plant domestication are limited due to lack of relevant genetic and genomic information of dye plants. Strobilanthes cusia (Acanthaceae) is a typical indigo-rich plant important to diverse ethnic cultures in many regions of Asia. Here we present a chromosome-scale genome for S. cusia with a genome size of approximately 865~Mb. About 79\% of the sequences were identified as repetitive sequences and 32~148 protein-coding genes were annotated. Metabolic analysis showed that the main indigoid pigments (indican, indigo and indirubin) were mainly synthesized in the leaves and stems of S. cusia. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression level of genes encoding metabolic enzymes such as monooxygenase, uridine diphosphate-glycosyltransferase and {$\beta$}-glucosidase were significantly changed in leaves and stems compared with root tissues, implying their participation in indigo biosynthesis. We found that several gene families involved in indigo biosynthesis had undergone an expansion in number, with functional differentiation likely facilitating indigo biosynthesis in S. cusia. This study provides insight into the physiological and molecular bases of indigo biosynthesis, as well as providing genomic data that provide the basis for further study of S. cusia cultivation by Asia's traditional textile producers.},

  abstract = {Methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is a prevalent DNA modification found in many organisms. Sequential oxidation of 5mC by ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases results in a cascade of additional epigenetic marks and promotes demethylation of DNA in mammals1,2. However, the enzymatic activity and function of TET homologues in other eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here we show that the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains a 5mC-modifying enzyme (CMD1) that is a TET homologue and catalyses the conjugation of a glyceryl moiety to the methyl group of 5mC through a carbon\textendash carbon bond, resulting in two stereoisomeric nucleobase products. The catalytic activity of CMD1 requires Fe(ii) and the integrity of its binding motif His-X-Asp, which is conserved in Fe-dependent dioxygenases3. However, unlike previously described TET enzymes, which use 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate4, CMD1 uses l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as an essential co-substrate. Vitamin C donates the glyceryl moiety to 5mC with concurrent formation of glyoxylic acid and CO2. The vitamin-C-derived DNA modification is present in the genome of wild-type C. reinhardtii but at a substantially lower level in a CMD1 mutant strain. The fitness of CMD1 mutant cells during exposure to high light levels is reduced. LHCSR3, a gene that is critical for the protection of C. reinhardtii from photo-oxidative damage under high light conditions, is hypermethylated and downregulated in CMD1 mutant cells compared to wild-type cells, causing a reduced capacity for photoprotective non-photochemical quenching. Our study thus identifies a eukaryotic DNA base modification that is catalysed by a divergent TET homologue and unexpectedly derived from vitamin C, and describes its role as a potential epigenetic mark that may counteract DNA methylation in the regulation of photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {摘要 Heterosis is most frequently manifested by the substantially increased vigorous growth of hybrids compared with their parents. Investigating genomic variations in natural populations is essential to understand the initial molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in plants. Here, we characterized the genomic architecture associated with biomass heterosis in 200 Arabidopsis hybrids. The genome-wide heterozygosity of hybrids makes a limited contribution to biomass heterosis, and no locus shows an obvious overdominance effect in hybrids. However, the accumulation of significant genetic loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in hybrids strongly correlates with better-parent heterosis (BPH). Candidate genes for biomass BPH fall into diverse biological functions, including cellular, metabolic, and developmental processes and stimulus-responsive pathways. Important heterosis candidates include WUSCHEL, ARGOS, and some genes that encode key factors involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses in representative Arabidopsis hybrid combinations reveal that heterosis candidate genes are functionally enriched in stimulus-responsive pathways, including responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli and immune responses. In addition, stimulus-responsive genes are repressed to low-parent levels in hybrids with high BPH, whereas middle-parent expression patterns are exhibited in hybrids with no BPH. Our study reveals a genomic architecture for understanding the molecular mechanisms of biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis, in which the accumulation of the superior alleles of genes involved in metabolic and cellular processes improve the development and growth of hybrids, whereas the overall repressed expression of stimulus-responsive genes prioritizes growth over responding to environmental stimuli in hybrids under normal conditions. 杂种优势最常见的表现是杂种与其亲本相比生长旺盛。研究自然群体的基因组变异对于了解植物杂种优势的初始分子机制具有重要意义。在这里，我们描述了200个拟南芥杂交种与生物量杂种优势相关的基因组结构。杂种全基因组杂合度对生物量杂种优势贡献有限，杂种无明显的超显性效应。然而，在全基因组关联研究(GWAS)中发现的显著遗传位点在杂种中的积累与较好的亲本杂种优势(BPH)密切相关。生物量 BPH 的候选基因具有多种生物学功能，包括细胞、代谢和发育过程以及刺激反应途径。重要的杂种优势候选基因包括 WUSCHEL、 ARGOS 和一些编码细胞周期调控关键因子的基因。有趣的是，代表性的拟南芥杂交组合的转录组分析表明，杂种优势候选基因在刺激响应途径中功能性丰富，包括对生物和非生物刺激的响应和免疫反应。此外，刺激反应基因在高 BPH 杂交种中表现为低亲本水平，而在无 BPH 杂交种中表现为中亲本表达模式。我们的研究揭示了拟南芥生物量杂种优势的分子机制的基因组结构，在这种结构中，参与代谢和细胞过程的基因的优势等位基因的积累促进了杂种的发育和生长，而刺激反应基因的整体抑制表达优先于环境刺激的响应在正常条件下的杂种优先生长。},

  abstract = {Deleterious alleles have long been proposed to play an important role in patterning phenotypic variation and are central to commonly held ideas explaining the hybrid vigor observed in the offspring of a cross between two inbred parents. We test these ideas using evolutionary measures of sequence conservation to ask whether incorporating information about putatively deleterious alleles can inform genomic selection (GS) models and improve phenotypic prediction. We measured a number of agronomic traits in both the inbred parents and hybrids of an elite maize partial diallel population and re-sequenced the parents of the population. Inbred elite maize lines vary for more than 350,000 putatively deleterious sites, but show a lower burden of such sites than a comparable set of traditional landraces. Our modeling reveals widespread evidence for incomplete dominance at these loci, and supports theoretical models that more damaging variants are usually more recessive. We identify haplotype blocks using an identity-by-decent (IBD) analysis and perform genomic prediction analyses in which we weigh blocks on the basis of complementation for segregating putatively deleterious variants. Cross-validation results show that incorporating sequence conservation in genomic selection improves prediction accuracy for grain yield and other fitness-related traits as well as heterosis for those traits. Our results provide empirical support for an important role for incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in explaining heterosis and demonstrate the utility of incorporating functional annotation in phenotypic prediction and plant breeding.},

In the MIM experiment, multiple predicted metabolite ions were monitored in both Q1 and Q3. The collision energy in Q2 was set to a low value to minimize fragmentation. Results from analyzing ritonavir metabolites in rat hepatocytes demonstrate that MIM-EPI was capable of targeting a larger number of metabolites regardless of their fragmentation and retained sensitivity and duty cycle similar to multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-EPI. MIM-based scanning methods were shown to be particularly useful in several applications. First, MIM-EPI enabled the sensitive detection and MS/MS acquisition of up to 100 predicted metabolites. Second, MIM-MRM-EPI was better than MRM-EPI in the analysis of metabolites that undergo either predictable or unpredictable fragmentation pathways. Finally, a combination of MIM-EPI and full-scan MS (EMS), as an alternative to EMS-EPI, was well suited for routine in vitro metabolite profiling. Overall, MIM-EPI significantly enhanced the metabolite identification capability of the hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap LC/MS.},

We performed genome-wide identification of circRNAs in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana using publically available RNA-Seq data, analyzed and compared features of plant and animal circRNAs. circRNAs (12037 and 6012) were identified in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively, with 56\% (10/18) of the sampled rice exonic circRNAs validated experimentally. Parent genes of over 700 exonic circRNAs were orthologues between rice and Arabidopsis, suggesting conservation of circRNAs in plants. The introns flanking plant circRNAs were much longer than introns from linear genes, and possessed less repetitive elements and reverse complementary sequences than the flanking introns of animal circRNAs. Plant circRNAs showed diverse expression patterns, and 27 rice exonic circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed under phosphate-sufficient and -starvation conditions. A significantly positive correlation was observed for the expression profiles of some circRNAs and their parent genes. Our results demonstrated that circRNAs are widespread in plants, revealed the common and distinct features of circRNAs between plants and animals, and suggested that circRNAs could be a critical class of noncoding regulators in plants.},

Increasing numbers of circRNAs are being identified in plants and animals, and recent studies have shown that circRNAs play an important role in gene regulation. Therefore, identifying circRNAs from increasing amounts of RNA-seq data is very important. However, traditional circRNA recognition methods have limitations. In recent years, emerging machine learning techniques have provided a good approach for the identification of circRNAs in animals. However, using these features to identify plant circRNAs is infeasible because the characteristics of plant circRNA sequences are different from those of animal circRNAs. For example, plants are extremely rich in splicing signals and transposable elements, and their sequence conservation in rice, for example is far less than that in mammals. To solve these problems and better identify circRNAs in plants, it is urgent to develop circRNA recognition software using machine learning based on the characteristics of plant circRNAs.},

  abstract = {During their evolution, plants have acquired the ability to produce a huge variety of compounds. Unlike the specialized metabolites that accumulate in limited numbers of species, flavonoids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Therefore, a detailed analysis of flavonoid metabolism in genomics and metabolomics is an ideal way to investigate how plants have developed their unique metabolic pathways during the process of evolution. More comprehensive and precise metabolite profiling integrated with genomic information are helpful to emerge unexpected gene functions and/or pathways. The distribution of flavonoids and their biosynthetic genes in the plant kingdom suggests that flavonoid biosynthetic pathways evolved through a series of steps. The enzymes that form the flavonoid scaffold structures probably first appeared by recruitment of enzymes from primary metabolic pathways, and later, enzymes that belong to superfamilies such as 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, cytochrome P450, and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase modified and varied the structures. It is widely accepted that the first two enzymes in flavonoid biosynthesis, chalcone synthase, and chalcone isomerase, were derived from common ancestors with enzymes in lipid metabolism. Later enzymes acquired their function by gene duplication and the subsequent acquisition of new functions. In this review, we describe the recent progress in metabolomics technologies for flavonoids and the evolution of flavonoid skeleton biosynthetic enzymes to understand the complicate evolutionary traits of flavonoid metabolism in plant kingdom.},

This protein, one of 11 homologues in Arabidopsis thaliana, is most closely related to the Pinus taeda phenylpropenal double bond reductase, involved in, for example, heartwood formation. Both enzymes also have essential roles in plant defense, and can function by catalyzing the reduction of the 7-8-double bond of phenylpropanal substrates, such as p-coumaryl and coniferyl aldehydes in vitro. At5g16970 is also capable of reducing toxic substrates with the same alkenal functionality, such as 4-hydroxy-(2E)-nonenal. The overall fold of At5g16970 is similar to that of the zinc-independent medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, the members of which have two domains and are dimeric in nature, i.e. in contrast to their original classification as being zinc-containing oxidoreductases. As provisionally anticipated from the kinetic data, the shape of the binding pocket can readily accommodate p-coumaryl aldehyde, coniferyl aldehyde, 4-hydroxy-(2E)-nonenal, and 2-alkenals. However, the enzyme kinetic data among these potential substrates differ, favoring p-coumaryl aldehyde. Tyr-260 is provisionally proposed to function as a general acid/base for hydride transfer. A catalytic mechanism for this reduction, and its applicability to related important detoxification mammalian proteins, is also proposed.},

Information on ALA was collected from the internet database PubMed, Elsevier, ResearchGate, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, and Europe PMC using a combination of keywords including ``pharmacology,'' ``metabolism,'' ``sources.'' The following findings are mainly contained. (a) ALA can only be ingested from food and then converted into eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the body. (b) This conversion process is relatively limited and affected by many factors such as dose, gender, and disease. (c) Pharmacological research shows that ALA has the anti-metabolic syndrome, anticancer, antiinflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-obesity, neuroprotection, and regulation of the intestinal flora properties. (d) There are the most studies that prove ALA has anti-metabolic syndrome effects, including experimental studies and clinical trials.

In short, ALA is expected to treat many diseases, but further high quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of ALA.},

Here, we report the stepwise selection and regulation of major fruit quality traits that occurred during watermelon evolution. The levels of fruit cucurbitacins and flavonoids were negatively selected during speciation, whereas sugar and carotenoid contents were positively selected during domestication. Interestingly, fruit malic acid and citric acid showed the opposite selection trends during the improvement. We identified a novel gene cluster (CGC1, cucurbitacin gene cluster on chromosome 1) containing both regulatory and structural genes involved in cucurbitacin biosynthesis, which revealed a cascade of transcriptional regulation operating mechanisms. In the CGC1, an allele caused a single nucleotide change in ClERF1 binding sites (GCC-box) in the promoter of ClBh1, which resulted in reduced expression of ClBh1 and inhibition of cucurbitacin synthesis in cultivated watermelon. Functional analysis revealed that a rare insertion of 244 amino acids, which arose in C. amarus and became fixed in sweet watermelon, in ClOSC (oxidosqualene cyclase) was critical for the negative selection of cucurbitacins during watermelon evolution. This research provides an important resource for metabolomics-assisted breeding in watermelon and for exploring metabolic pathway regulation mechanisms.},

Recent studies indicate that the plant immune system plays an active role in influencing rhizosphere microbiome composition. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that root-invading beneficial microbes, including rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhiza, evade or suppress host immunity to establish a mutualistic relationship with their host. Evidence is accumulating that many free-living rhizosphere microbiota members can suppress root immune responses, highlighting root immune suppression as an important function of the root microbiome. Thus, the gate keeping functions of the plant immune system are not restricted to warding off root-invading pathogens but also extend to rhizosphere microbiota, likely to promote colonization by beneficial microbes and prevent growth-defense tradeoffs triggered by the MAMP-rich rhizosphere environment.},

  abstract = {Isobaric labeling has the promise of combining high sample multiplexing with precise quantification. However, normalization issues and the missing value problem of complete n-plexes hamper quantification across more than one n-plex. Here, we introduce two novel algorithms implemented in MaxQuant that substantially improve the data analysis with multiple n-plexes. First, isobaric matching between runs makes use of the three-dimensional MS1 features to transfer identifications from identified to unidentified MS/MS spectra between liquid chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry runs in order to utilize reporter ion intensities in unidentified spectra for quantification. On typical datasets, we observe a significant gain in MS/MS spectra that can be used for quantification. Second, we introduce a novel PSM-level normalization, applicable to data with and without the common reference channel. It is a weighted median-based method, in which the weights reflect the number of ions that were used for fragmentation. On a typical dataset, we observe complete removal of batch effects and dominance of the biological sample grouping after normalization. Furthermore, we provide many novel processing and normalization options in Perseus, the companion software for the downstream analysis of quantitative proteomics results. All novel tools and algorithms are available with the regular MaxQuant and Perseus releases, which are downloadable at http://maxquant.org.},

  abstract = {Many bacterivorous and parasitic nematodes secrete signaling molecules called ascarosides that play a central role regulating their behavior and development. Combining stable-isotope labeling and mass spectrometry-based comparative metabolomics, here we show that ascarosides are taken up from the environment and metabolized by a wide range of phyla, including plants, fungi, bacteria, and mammals, as well as nematodes. In most tested eukaryotes and some bacteria, ascarosides are metabolized into derivatives with shortened fatty acid side chains, analogous to ascaroside biosynthesis in nematodes. In plants and C. elegans, labeled ascarosides were additionally integrated into larger, modular metabolites, and use of different ascaroside stereoisomers revealed the stereospecificity of their biosynthesis. The finding that nematodes extensively metabolize ascarosides taken up from the environment suggests that pheromone editing may play a role in conspecific and interspecific interactions. Moreover, our results indicate that plants, animals, and microorganisms may interact with associated nematodes via manipulation of ascaroside signaling.},

  abstract = {The root microbiome consists of commensal, pathogenic, and plant-beneficial microbes [1]. Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense~tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42\% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are~triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an~important function of the root microbiome. In~a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12pro:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than~wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12pro:GUS and MYB51pro:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that~suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates colonization by beneficial root microbiota.},

It has been reported that circRNA can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, transcriptional regulators, or potential biomarkers. The availability of massive non-polyadenylated transcriptomes data has facilitated the genome-wide identification of thousands of circRNAs. Several circRNA detection tools or pipelines have recently been developed, and it is essential to provide useful guidelines on these pipelines for users, including a comprehensive and unbiased comparison. Here, we provide an improved and easy-to-use circRNA read simulator that can produce mimicking backsplicing reads supporting circRNAs deposited in CircBase. Moreover, we compared the performance of 11 circRNA detection tools on both simulated and real datasets. We assessed their performance regarding metrics such as precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and Area under Curve. It is concluded that no single method dominated on all of these metrics. Among all of the state-of-the-art tools, CIRI, CIRCexplorer, and KNIFE, which achieved better balanced performance between their precision and sensitivity, compared favorably to the other methods.},

Our results demonstrated both constitutive and induced accumulation, and common genetic regulation, of metabolites from different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway that are involved in UV-B protection. A total of 90 significant mGWAS loci for these metabolites were identified in barley-qingke differentiation regions, and a number of high-level metabolite trait alleles were found to be significantly enriched in qingke, suggesting co-selection of various phenylpropanoids. Upon dissecting the entire phenylpropanoid pathway, we identified some key determinants controlling natural variation of phenylpropanoid content, including three novel proteins, a flavone C-pentosyltransferase, a tyramine hydroxycinnamoyl acyltransferase, and a~MYB transcription factor.

By constructing pseudo-circular reference for re-alignment of RNA-seq reads and employing sophisticated statistical models to correct RNase R treatment biases, CIRIquant can provide more accurate expression values for circRNAs with significantly reduced false discovery rate. We further develop a one-stop differential expression analysis pipeline implementing two independent measures, which helps unveil the regulation of competitive splicing between circRNAs and their linear counterparts. We apply CIRIquant to RNA-seq datasets of hepatocellular carcinoma, and characterize two important groups of linear-circular switching and circular transcript usage switching events, which demonstrate the promising ability to explore extensive transcriptomic changes in liver tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {Scope In this study, whether amination is a novel metabolic pathway of myricetin, one of the major dietary flavonoids found in fruits, vegetables, and tea, and whether the aminated metabolite of myricetin remains bioactive, are investigated. Methods and results It is found that myricetin with a vic-trihydroxyl group on the B ring can chemically react with ammonia via the formation of myricetin quinone to generate the aminated product in vitro. As expected, the amination occurs on position 4\textasciiacute{} of the B-ring of myricetin. The structure of this new product is confirmed by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and is named 4\textasciiacute -NH2-myricetin. Using the synthetic 4\textasciiacute -NH2-myricetin as a standard, the presence of this compound is searched for in fecal samples collected from myricetin-treated mice using LC\textendash MS, and 4\textasciiacute -NH2-myricetin is confirmed as the metabolite of myricetin in mice for the first time. Furthermore, two metabolites of myricetin, the mono-methylated myricetin and the microbial-derived metabolite 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylacetic acid, are confirmed to be aminated in vivo based on LC\textendash MS data analysis. After administration of different doses of myricetin through oral gavage, the amination of myricetin shows a dose-dependent response in feces. A similar trend is observed for the amination of the mono-methylated myricetin, but not for the microbial-derived metabolite 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylacetic acid. In plasma, the trend of a dose-dependent response for the amination of myricetin and its mono methylated metabolite is observed, and the plasma concentration of the aminated 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylacetic acid at 200 mg kg\textendash 1 dose is significantly higher than those at the 100 and 400 mg kg\textendash 1 doses. Interestingly, it is observed that the aminated myricetin retains the anti-inflammatory activity of myricetin. Conclusion This result demonstrates that amination is a novel biotransformation mechanism of myricetin to produce aminated metabolites.},

The formation of such circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs) can be recapitulated using expression vectors, and their processing depends on a consensus motif containing a 7 nt GU-rich element near the 5' splice site and an 11 nt C-rich element close to the branchpoint site. In addition, we show that ciRNAs are abundant in the nucleus and have little enrichment for microRNA target sites. Importantly, knockdown of ciRNAs led to the reduced expression of their parent genes. One abundant such RNA, ci-ankrd52, largely accumulates to its sites of transcription, associates with elongation Pol II machinery, and acts as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription. This study thus suggests a cis-regulatory role of noncoding intronic transcripts on their parent coding genes.},

  abstract = {The F-box domain containing proteins is one of the super protein families in Eukaryotic cells including yeast, plant, and mammals. For example, the model plant Arabidopsis and Medicago genomes contain nearly 700 and 1000 F-box protein encoding genes, respectively, which are the two largest gene families in the plant kingdom. Excluding the N-terminal signature, the approximately 40\textendash 50 conserved amino-acid F-box motif and their C-terminal protein\textendash protein interaction domains define the different F-box protein subfamilies. Most of the F-box proteins studied so far can interact with SKP proteins, together with Cullin and Rbx1 to form the SCF complexes, which are the classic and most well-studied E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Through the F-box protein C-terminal domains, the SCF complexes confer the specificity of selective protein ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome, and this process is routinely termed as the ubiquitin\textendash protease pathway (UPP). UPP-mediated protein degradation is one of the key regulatory mechanisms for protein stability and is the major protein degradation pathway for the majority of the intracellular proteins. Since the first plant F-box gene, UFO (Unusual Floral Organs) was isolated in 1995, a collection of about 20 plant F-box genes have been identified and functionally characterised. Proteins encoded by plant F-box genes have been revealed to be functionally diverse and play a variety of roles in developmental processes including plant hormonal signal transduction, floral development, secondary metabolism, senescence, circadian rhythms, and responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In recent years, with the rapid improvements of new genome sequencing technologies, hundreds of F-box genes from every sequenced plant species have been identified. Comparing with the large number of F-box genes identified so far, only a handful of them have been studied in detail and the functional characterisation of the majority of F-box gene families remains unknown. This article summarises our current understanding of plant F-box proteins, including their classification and the pathways that they regulate, and seeks to lay the foundation for a systematical investigation of F-box genes in plants.},

A metabolomics approach based on gas chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (GC\textendash MS) and chemometrics was established in this study to evaluate the anti-hyperlipidaemic activity of PVPs in a high-fat Sprague-Dawley rat model. In vivo, PVPs could significantly reduce the weight gain and the increases in serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C levels observed in rats fed a high-fat diet; they could also significantly increase serum GSH-Px activity, reduce the content of MDA and TNF-{$\alpha$} and decrease abdominal fat volume in rats. Furthermore, PVPs exerted a repairing effect on morphological and structural damage in liver tissue cells in hyperlipidaemic rats fed a high-fat diet. PVPs improved lipid metabolism disorder in rats. Alanine, threonine, succinic acid, proline, inositol and arachidonic acid levels in the serum were considered potential biomarkers involved in amino acid, glucose, energy and lipid metabolism. Therefore, PVPs may interfere with hyperlipidaemia through anti-lipid peroxidation effects, attenuation of inflammation and regulation of glucose, amino acid, energy and lipid metabolism.},

Fifty-four outlier SNP loci were identified by selection-scan analysis, and 3 SNPs were located in genes related to the processes of plant responding to stress conditions and confirmed through further genome-wide signals of marker-phenotype association analysis, which indicate a clear selection signature for such trait.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize (Zea mays) ear length, which is an important yield component, exhibits strong heterosis. Understanding the potential molecular mechanisms of ear-length heterosis is critical for efficient yield-related breeding. RESULTS: Here, a joint netted pattern, including six parent-hybrid triplets, was designed on the basis of two maize lines harboring long (T121 line) and short (T126 line) ears. Global transcriptional profiling of young ears (containing meristem) was performed. Multiple comparative analyses revealed that 874 differentially expressed genes are mainly responsible for the ear-length variation between T121 and T126 lines. Among them, four key genes, Zm00001d049958, Zm00001d027359, Zm00001d048502 and Zm00001d052138, were identified as being related to meristem development, which corroborated their roles in the superior additive genetic effects on ear length in T121 line. Non-additive expression patterns were used to identify candidate genes related to ear-length heterosis. A non-additively expressed gene (Zm00001d050649) was associated with the timing of meristematic phase transition and was determined to be the homolog of tomato SELF PRUNING, which assists SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS in driving yield-related heterosis, indicating that Zm00001d050649 is a potential contributor to drive heterotic effect on ear length. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that inbred parents provide genetic and heterotic effects on the ear lengths of their corresponding F1 hybrids through two independent pathways. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the transcriptional regulation of ear length and improve the understanding of ear-length heterosis in maize.},

As a main substance filled in the cellulose framework during the secondary wall thickening process, lignin plays a key role in the formation of cotton fiber quality. However, the mechanism behind it is still unclear. In this research, we screened candidate genes involved in lignin biosynthesis based on analysis of cotton genome and transcriptome sequence data. The authenticity of the transcriptome data was verified by qRT-PCR assay. Total 62 genes were identified from nine gene families. In the process, we found the key gene GhCAD7 that affects the biosynthesis of S-lignin and the ratio of syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G). In addition, in combination with the metabolites and transcriptome profiles of the line 0-153 with high fiber quality and the line sGK9708 with low fiber quality during cotton fiber development, we speculate that the ratio of syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) is inseparable from the quality of cotton fiber. Finally, the S-type lignin synthesis branch may play a more important role in the formation of high-quality fiber. This work provides insights into the synthesis of lignin in cotton and lays the foundation for future research into improving fiber quality.},

However, studies on domestication-driven changes in the metabolome and genetic basis of bioactive molecules in perennial fruit trees are generally lacking. Here, we conducted multidimensional analyses revealing a singular domestication event involving the genomic and metabolomic selection of jujube trees (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). The genomic selection for domesticated genes was highly enriched in metabolic pathways, including carbohydrates and specialized metabolism. Domesticated metabolome profiling indicated that 187 metabolites exhibited significant divergence as a result of directional selection. Malic acid was directly selected during domestication, and the simultaneous selection of specialized metabolites, including triterpenes, consequently lead to edible properties. Cyclopeptide alkaloids (CPAs) were specifically targeted for the divergence between dry and fresh cultivars. We identified 1080 significantly associated loci for 986 metabolites. Among them, 15 triterpenes were directly selected at six major loci, allowing the identification of a homologous cluster containing seven 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs). An OSC gene was found to contribute to the reduction in the content of triterpenes during domestication. The complete pathway for synthesizing ursolic acid was dissected by integration of the metabolome and transcriptome. Additionally, an N-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of CPA and responsible for inter-cultivar content variation was identified. The present study promotes our understanding of the selection process of the global metabolome subsequent to fruit tree domestication and facilitates the genetic manipulation of specialized metabolites to enhance their edible traits.},

  abstract = {Drought is a major abiotic stress that threatens global food security. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous RNAs. How these molecules influence plant stress responses remains elusive. Here, a large-scale circRNA profiling identified 2174 and 1354 high-confidence circRNAs in maize and Arabidopsis, respectively, and most were differentially expressed in response to drought. A substantial number of drought-associated circRNA-hosting genes were involved in conserved or species-specific pathways in drought responses. Comparative analysis revealed that circRNA biogenesis was more complex in maize than in Arabidopsis. In most cases, maize circRNAs were negatively correlated with sRNA accumulation. In 368 maize inbred lines, the circRNA-hosting genes were enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with circRNA expression and drought tolerance, implying either important roles of circRNAs in maize drought responses or their potential use as biomarkers for breeding drought-tolerant maize. Additionally, the expression levels of circRNAs derived from drought-responsible genes encoding calcium-dependent protein kinase and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase were significantly associated with drought tolerance of maize seedlings. Specifically, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing circGORK (Guard cell outward-rectifying K+ -channel) were hypersensitive to abscisic acid, but insensitive to drought, suggesting a positive role of circGORK in drought tolerance. We report the transcriptomic profiling and transgenic studies of circRNAs in plant drought responses, and provide evidence highlighting the universal molecular mechanisms involved in plant drought tolerance.},

In our present study, we identified 36 putative MRS2/MGT genes (BnMGTs) from B. napus and investigated their phylogeny, expression pattern and function. These BnMGT genes were sorted into five distinguished groups by the phylogenetic analysis, and they were clearly homologous with the MRS2/MGT genes in Arabidopsis and rice. Complementation assays using the Salmonella typhimurium mutant MM281 demonstrated that the BnMGT genes were capable of mediating Mg2+ uptake and transport, with varied affinities to Mg2+. The expression pattern analysis showed that the expression of BnMGTs were tissue-specific and varied in different tissues. This work provides the molecular basis to discover the function of BnMGT gene family in plant growth and development.},

  abstract = {The decision to replicate its DNA is of crucial importance for every cell and, in many organisms, is decisive for the progression through the entire cell cycle. A comparison of animals versus yeast has shown that, although most of the involved cell-cycle regulators are divergent in both clades, they fulfill a similar role and the overall network topology of G1/S regulation is highly conserved. Using germline development as a model system, we identified a regulatory cascade controlling entry into S phase in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which, as a member of the Plantae supergroup, is phylogenetically only distantly related to Opisthokonts such as yeast and animals. This module comprises the Arabidopsis homologs of the animal transcription factor E2F, the plant homolog of the animal transcriptional repressor Retinoblastoma (Rb)-related 1 (RBR1), the plant-specific F-box protein F-BOX-LIKE 17 (FBL17), the plant specific cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors KRPs, as well as CDKA;1, the plant homolog of the yeast and animal Cdc2+/Cdk1 kinases. Our data show that the principle of a double negative wiring of Rb proteins is highly conserved, likely representing a universal mechanism in eukaryotic cell-cycle control. However, this negative feedback of Rb proteins is differently implemented in plants as it is brought about through a quadruple negative regulation centered around the F-box protein FBL17 that mediates the degradation of CDK inhibitors but is itself directly repressed by Rb. Biomathematical simulations and subsequent experimental confirmation of computational predictions revealed that this regulatory circuit can give rise to hysteresis highlighting the here identified dosage sensitivity of CDK inhibitors in this network., In order to grow, multicellular organisms need to multiply their cells. Cell proliferation is achieved through a complex order of events called the cell cycle, during which the nuclear DNA is duplicated and subsequently distributed to the newly forming daughter cells. The decision to replicate the nuclear DNA is in many organisms crucial to progress through the entire cell cycle. Alterations of the cell cycle, especially at the entry point, can cause severe developmental defects and are often causal for maladies, such as cancer. Substantial work in yeast and animals has revealed the regulatory steps controlling S-phase entry. In contrast, relatively little is known about the plant cell cycle despite plants being one of the largest classes of living organisms and despite the importance of plants for human life, for instance as the basis of human nutrition. Our work presents a molecular framework of core cell-cycle regulation for entry into the DNA replication phase in the model plant Arabidopsis. We report here the identification of a regulatory cascade that likely functions in many plant cells and organisms. With this, we also provide an important basis for comparative analyses of cell-cycle control between different eukaryotes, such as yeast and mammals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interspecific hybridization and whole genome duplication are driving forces of genomic and organism diversification. But the effect of interspecific hybridization and whole genome duplication on the non-coding portion of the genome in particular remains largely unknown. In this study, we examine the profile of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), comparing them with that of coding genes in allotetraploid cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), its putative diploid ancestors (G. arboreum; G. raimondii), and an F1 hybrid (G. arboreum \texttimes{} G. raimondii, AD). RESULTS: We find that most lncRNAs (80\%) that were allelic expressed in the allotetraploid genome. Moreover, the genome shock of hybridization reprograms the non-coding transcriptome in the F1 hybrid. Interestingly, the activated lncRNAs are predominantly transcribed from demethylated TE regions, especially from long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). The DNA methylation dynamics in the interspecies hybridization are predominantly associated with the drastic expression variation of lncRNAs. Similar trends of lncRNA bursting are also observed in the progress of polyploidization. Additionally, we find that a representative novel lncRNA XLOC\_409583 activated after polyploidization from a LINE in the A subgenome of allotetraploid cotton was involved in control of cotton seedling height. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that the processes of hybridization and polyploidization enable the neofunctionalization of lncRNA transcripts, acting as important sources of increased plasticity for plants.},

A vacuolar membrane-localized multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) transporter, Medicago MATE1, was identified at the molecular level and shown to preferentially transport epicatechin 3{${'}$}-O-glucoside. Genetic evidence has implicated TT12, a tonoplastic MATE transporter from Arabidopsis, in the transport of precursors for proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in the seed coat. However, although Arabidopsis TT12 facilitates the transport of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside into membrane vesicles when expressed in yeast, there is no evidence that cyanidin 3-O-glucoside is converted to proanthocyanidins after transport into the vacuole. Here, we show that Arabidopsis TT12, like Medicago MATE1, functions to transport epicatechin 3{${'}$}-O-glucoside as a precursor for proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, and Medicago MATE1 complements the seed proanthocyanidin phenotype of the Arabidopsis tt12 mutant both quantitatively and qualitatively. On the basis of biochemical properties, tissue-specific expression pattern, and genetic loss-of-function analysis, we conclude that MATE1 is an essential membrane transporter for proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in the Medicago seed coat. Implications of these findings for the assembly of oligomeric proanthocyanidins are discussed.},

In this study, a comparative proteomic analysis between a short-lint fiber mutant (Ligon lintless, Li1) and its wild-type was performed to identify fiber elongation-related proteins. By 2-DE combined with local EST database-assisted MS/MS analysis, 81 differentially expressed proteins assigned to different functional categories were identified from Li1 fibers, of which 54 were down-regulated and 27 were up-regulated. Several novel aspects regarding cotton fiber elongation can be illustrated from our data. First, over half of the down-regulated proteins were newly identified at the protein level, which is mainly involved in protein folding and stabilization, nucleocytoplasmic transport, signal transduction, and vesicular-mediated transport. Second, a number of cytoskeleton-related proteins showed a remarkable decrease in protein abundance in the Li1 fibers. Accordingly, the architecture of actin cytoskeleton was severely deformed and the microtubule organization was moderately altered, accompanied with dramatic disruption of vesicle trafficking. Third, the expression of several proteins involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) was activated in Li1 fibers, indicating that the deficiency of fiber cell elongation was related to ER stress. Collectively, these findings significantly advanced our understanding of the mechanisms associated with cotton fiber elongation.},

Although they are non-biased and have high coverage, untargeted approaches suffer from unsatisfying repeatability and a requirement for complex data processing. Targeted metabolomics based on triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (TQMS) could be a complementary tool because of its high sensitivity, high specificity and excellent quantification ability. However, it is usually applicable to known compounds: compounds whose identities are known and/or are expected to be present in the analyzed samples. Pseudotargeted metabolomics merges the advantages of untargeted and targeted metabolomics and can act as an alternative to the untargeted method. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of pseudotargeted metabolomics using UHPLC-TQMS. An in-depth, untargeted metabolomics experiment involving multiple UHPLC-HRMS runs with MS at different collision energies (both positive and negative) is performed using a mixture obtained using small amounts of the analyzed samples. XCMS, CAMERA and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)-Ion Pair Finder are used to find and annotate peaks and choose transitions that will be used to analyze the real samples. A set of internal standards is used to correct for variations in retention time. High coverage and high-performance quantitative analysis can be realized. The entire protocol takes \textasciitilde 5 d to complete and enables the simultaneously semiquantitative analysis of 800\textendash 1,300 metabolites.},

Grafting has crucial impacts on various phenotypes of the cultivar including phenology, biotic and abiotic resistance, berry metabolome and coloring, however, the genetics and regulation mechanisms are largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic, metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles at three stages (45, 75 and 105~days after flowering) of the Crimson Seedless (Vitis vinifera, CS) cultivar grafted to four rootstocks (three heterografting: CS/101\textendash 14, CS/SO4, CS/110R and one self-grafting CS/CS) with an own-rooted grafting-free Crimson Seedless (CS) used as the control. All the heterografting had a significant effect on berry reddening as early as \textasciitilde 45~days after flowering. The grafting of rootstocks promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in grape berries. The metabolomic features showed that Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-glucosid, Malvidin 3-O-glucoside, Peonidin 3-O-glucoside and Petunidin 3-O-glucoside were the pigments responsible for the purplish-red color peels. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that anthocyanins biosynthetic related genes from the upstream (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) to the downstream (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase and anthocyanidin synthase) were upregulated with the accumulations of anthocyanins in heterografted plants: CS/101\textendash 14, CS/SO4 and CS/110R. At the same time, all these genes were also highly expressed and more anthocyanin was accumulated in self-grafted CS/CS samples compared to own-rooted grafting-free CS samples, suggesting that self-grafting might also have promoted berry reddening in grapevine. Our results provide global transcriptomic and metabolomic features in the regulation of berry coloring under different grafting conditions for improving the berry quality in viticulture.},

  abstract = {s Cotton fiber is considered as the backbone of the textile industry. The productivity of cotton crop is severely hampered by the occurrence of pathogens, pests, and various environmental factors. Nevertheless, cotton plant has developed sophisticated mechanisms to respond to environment stresses to avoid detrimental effects on its growth and development. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of cotton fiber development and environment stress response is of considerable interest for designing agriculture breeding strategies to ensure sustainable productivity. The application of proteomics technologies to advance our knowledge in cotton fiber development and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance has increased dramatically in the last 5years as evidenced by the large amount of publications in this area. This review summarizes the work which has been reported for cotton proteomics and evaluates the findings in context of the approaches that are widely employed with the aim to generate novel insight useful for cotton improvement. Biological significance Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is considered as the foremost commercially important fiber crop grown all over the world and is deemed as the backbone of the textile industry. Cotton is also an important source of edible oil seed and a nutrient-rich food crop as cottonseed contains high-quality protein and oil. The growth and productivity of cotton crop are often hampered by various biotic stress factors, such as insect pests and pathogens. In addition, cotton plants are frequently subjected to unavoidable environmental factors that cause abiotic stress, such as salt, heat and drought. Proteomic techniques provide one of the best options for understanding the gene function and phenotypic changes during cotton fiber development and stress response. This review first summarizes the work which has been reported for cotton proteomics about cotton fiber development and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance, and also evaluates the findings in context of the approaches that are widely employed during last 5years, with the aim to generate novel insight useful for cotton improvement.

Arabidopsis CYCLIN H;1 (CYCH;1) interacts with and activates CDKDs; however, the physiological function of CYCH;1 has not been determined. Here, we report that CYCH;1, which is localized to the nucleus, positively regulates blue light-induced stomatal opening. Reduced-function cych;1 RNA interference (cych;1 RNAi) plants exhibited a drought tolerance phenotype. CYCH;1 is predominantly expressed in guard cells, and its expression was substantially down-regulated by dehydration. Transpiration of intact leaves was reduced in cych;1 RNAi plants compared with the wild-type control in light but not in darkness. CYCH;1 down-regulation impaired blue light-induced stomatal opening but did not affect guard cell development or abscisic acid-mediated stomatal closure. Microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that CYCH;1 did not regulate the expression of abscisic acid-responsive genes or light-induced stomatal opening signaling determinants, such as MYB60, MYB61, Hypersensitive to red and blue1, and Protein phosphatase7. CYCH;1 down-regulation induced the expression of redox homeostasis genes, such as LIPOXYGENASE3 (LOX3), LOX4, ARABIDOPSIS GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE 7 (ATGPX7), EARLY LIGHT-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN1 (ELIP1), and ELIP2, and increased hydrogen peroxide production in guard cells. Furthermore, loss-of-function mutations in CDKD;2 or CDKD;3 did not affect responsiveness to drought stress, suggesting that CYCH;1 regulates the drought stress response in a CDKD-independent manner. We propose that CYCH;1 regulates blue light-mediated stomatal opening by controlling reactive oxygen species homeostasis.},

The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions3,4. Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19\,million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24\% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the advent of second-generation sequencing, the expression of gene transcripts can be digitally measured with high accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically profile the expression of both mRNA and miRNA genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) using massively parallel sequencing technology. METHODOLOGY: The expression of mRNAs and miRNAs were analyzed in tumor tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues obtained from 10 ccRCC patients without distant metastases. In a prevalence screen, some of the most interesting results were validated in a large cohort of ccRCC patients. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 404 miRNAs and 9,799 mRNAs were detected to be differentially expressed in the 10 ccRCC patients. We also identified 56 novel miRNA candidates in at least two samples. In addition to confirming that canonical cancer genes and miRNAs (including VEGFA, DUSP9 and ERBB4; miR-210, miR-184 and miR-206) play pivotal roles in ccRCC development, promising novel candidates (such as PNCK and miR-122) without previous annotation in ccRCC carcinogenesis were also discovered in this study. Pathways controlling cell fates (e.g., cell cycle and apoptosis pathways) and cell communication (e.g., focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction) were found to be significantly more likely to be disrupted in ccRCC. Additionally, the results of the prevalence screen revealed that the expression of a miRNA gene cluster located on Xq27.3 was consistently downregulated in at least 76.7\% of {$\sim$}50 ccRCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided a two-dimensional map of the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of ccRCC using deep sequencing technology. Our results indicate that the phenotypic status of ccRCC is characterized by a loss of normal renal function, downregulation of metabolic genes, and upregulation of many signal transduction genes in key pathways. Furthermore, it can be concluded that downregulation of miRNA genes clustered on Xq27.3 is associated with ccRCC.},

  abstract = {Jasmine [Jasminum sambac (L.) Aiton] flowers usually bloom and release their fragrance at night. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of aroma formation during flowering in postharvest jasmine are still poorly understood. Here, we profiled the volatile metabolome, multi-flux full-length sequencing, and transcriptome analysis to investigate volatile biosynthesis and global transcriptomic changes in postharvest flowering jasmine. A total of 102 volatiles were identified. Of these, 16 volatiles were considered key odorants of jasmine flowers. Linalool, {$\alpha$}-farnesene, d-nerolidol, geraniol, {$\alpha$}-cadinol, benyzl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzyl acetate, benzyl benzoate, 3-hexen-1-ol benzoate, and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate play decisive roles in the typical jasmine fragrance, while benzeneacetaldehyde, benzoic acid, methyl anthranilate, methyl 2-(methylamino) benzoate, and (E)-2-hexenal modify the aroma of jasmine. Meanwhile, we built the first reference full-length transcriptome of postharvest jasmine flowers, which had 366,081 non-redundant isoforms. Among them, 280,326 (76.57 \%) were annotated with at least one hit in the NT, NR, Swissprot, KEGG, KOG, Pfam, and GO databases. Combined with second-generation transcriptome analysis, we identified 52 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) involved in terpenoid metabolic pathways and 28 DETs involved in phenylpropanoid/benzenoid metabolic pathway, and 31 {$\beta$}-glucosidase transcripts may be related to aroma formation of postharvest jasmine during flowering. In addition, the expression of 42 heat shock protein (HSP) transcripts was positively correlated with the content of 11 key odorants, as revealed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The present results advance the knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of aroma formation in postharvest jasmine during flowering and provide an abundant genetic resource for further studies on gene discovery in jasmine.},

Here, we develop an approach, namely, knowledge-guided multi-layer network (KGMN), to enable global metabolite annotation from knowns to unknowns in untargeted metabolomics. The KGMN approach integrates three-layer networks, including knowledge-based metabolic reaction network, knowledge-guided MS/MS similarity network, and global peak correlation network. To demonstrate the principle, we apply KGMN in an in~vitro enzymatic reaction system and different biological samples, with \textasciitilde 100\textendash 300 putative unknowns annotated in each data set. Among them, {$>$}80\% unknown metabolites are corroborated with in~silico MS/MS tools. Finally, we validate 5 metabolites that are absent in common MS/MS libraries through repository mining and synthesis of chemical standards. Together, the KGMN approach enables efficient unknown annotations, and substantially advances the discovery of recurrent unknown metabolites for common biological samples from model organisms, towards deciphering dark matter in untargeted metabolomics.},

  abstract = {Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instruments and analytical strategies have brought about great progress in targeted metabolomics analysis. This methodology is now capable of performing precise targeted measurement of dozens or hundreds of metabolites in complex biological samples. Classic targeted quantification assay using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode has been the foundation of high-quality metabolite quantitation. However, utilization of this strategy in biological studies has been limited by its relatively low metabolite coverage and throughput capacity. A number of methods for large-scale targeted metabolomics assay which have been developed overcome these limitations. These strategies have enabled extended metabolite coverage which is defined as targeting of large numbers of metabolites, while maintaining reliable quantification performance. These recently developed techniques thus bridge the gap between traditional targeted metabolite quantification and untargeted metabolomics profiling, and have proven to be powerful tools for metabolomics study. Although the LC-MRM-MS strategy has been used widely in large-scale metabolomics quantification analysis due to its fast scan speed and ideal analytic stability, there are still drawbacks which are due to the low resolution of the triple quadrupole instruments used for MRM assays. New approaches have been developed to expand the options for large-scale targeted metabolomics study, using high-resolution instruments such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). MRM and PRM-based techniques are now attractive strategies for quantitative metabolomics analysis and high-throughput biomarker discovery. Here we provide an overview of the major developments in LC-MS-based strategies for large-scale targeted metabolomics quantification in biological samples. The advantages of LC-MRM/PRM-MS based analytical strategies which may be used in multiplexed and high throughput quantitation for a wide range of metabolites are highlighted. In particular, PRM and MRM strategies are compared, and we summarize the work flow commonly used for large-scale targeted metabolomics analysis including sample preparation, LC separation and data analysis, as well as recent applications in biological studies.},

  abstract = {Heterosis or hybrid vigor has been used widely for more than a decade in Canola (Brassica napus) production. Canola hybrids show heterosis in a variety of traits compared to parents, including increased biomass at the early stages of seedling establishment, which is a critical developmental step that impacts future plant growth and seed yield. In this study, we examined transcriptomes of two parental lines, Garnet (Gar) and NX0052 (0052), and their reciprocal hybrids, Gar/0052, at 4 and 8\,days after sowing (DAS). In hybrids, early seedling biomass heterosis is correlated with earlier expression of genes in photosynthesis pathways relative to parents. The hybrids also showed early expression of genes in the auxin biosynthesis pathway, consistent with the higher auxin concentrations detected in hybrid seedlings at 4 DAS. Auxin is a key phytohormone that regulates plant development promoting cell expansion and cell proliferation. Consistent with the increased levels of auxin, hybrids have larger and more palisade cells than the parents at the same time point. We propose a possible mechanism of early biomass heterosis through the early establishment of photosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis, providing insights into how transcriptional changes in hybrids are translated into phenotypical heterosis. This finding could be utilized in future Canola breeding to identify hybrid combinations with the superior early seedling establishment and strong levels of hybrid vigor in later plant development.},

  abstract = {Background Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are 3{${'}$}-5{${'}$} head-to-tail covalently closed non-coding RNA that have been proved to play essential roles in many cellular and developmental processes. However, no information relate to cucumber circRNAs is available currently, especially under salt stress condition. Results In this study, we sequenced circRNAs in cucumber and a total of 2787 were identified, with 1934 in root and 44 in leaf being differentially regulated under salt stress. Characteristics analysis of these circRNAs revealed following features: most of them are exon circRNAs (79.51\%) and they prefer to arise from middle exon(s) of parent genes (2035/2516); moreover, most of circularization events (88.3\%) use non-canonical-GT/AG splicing signals; last but not least, pairing-driven circularization is not the major way to generate cucumber circRNAs since very few circRNAs (18) contain sufficient flanking complementary sequences. Annotation and enrichment analysis of both parental genes and target mRNAs were launched to uncover the functions of differentially expressed circRNAs induced by salt stress. The results showed that circRNAs may be paly roles in salt stress response by mediating transcription, signal transcription, cell cycle, metabolism adaptation, and ion homeostasis related pathways. Moreover, circRNAs may function to regulate proline metabolisms through regulating associated biosynthesis and degradation genes. Conclusions The present study identified large number of cucumber circRNAs and function annotation revealed their possible biological roles in response to salt stress. Our findings will lay a solid foundation for further structure and function studies of cucumber circRNAs.
